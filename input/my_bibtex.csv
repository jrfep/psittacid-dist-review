HOWEVER, ACTUAL STUDIES PROVIDING DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION ON THE DIFFERENT STATES ARE INEXISTENT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION CONCERNING ITS ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION ON MICHOACAN. WE EVALUATED 215 LOCALITIES FROM 3 PHYSIOGRAPHIC REGIONS THAT PRESENT SUITABLE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS DURING THE 2002-2008 PERIOD. ITS ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION WAS ANALYZED USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND ITS POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION WAS OBTAINED WITH THE GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR RULE SET PREDICTION (CARP). WE EVALUATED THE COINCIDENCE BETWEEN FIELD RECORDS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUITABLE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS (ELEVATION, VEGETATION) FOR THE SPECIES, GENERATED BY ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELING. WE CONFIRMED ITS PRESENCE ON THE MUNICIPALITIES OF LA HUACANA, CHURUMUCO, AND ARTEAGA, CONFIRMING ITS DISTRIBUTION ON 2 359 KM(2) FROM THE REGION KNOWN AS THE LOWER BALSAS BASIN. IN ADDITION, WE OBTAINED RECORDS ON THE SIERRA MADRE DEL SUR, HOWEVER THERE ARE LARGE AREAS FROM THIS REGION THAT REQUIRE FIELD CONFIRMATION, AND THE DISTRIBUTION FOR THIS REGION CAN STILL BE CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL. THE MILITARY MACAW INHABITED THE MICHOACAN COAST IN 1980, TODAY THE SPECIES ITS BEEN EXTIRPATED FROM AN ESTIMATED AREA OF I 303 KM(2). CONSIDERING THE EXTENT OF THE CONFIRMED DISTRIBUTION AND THE EXTENT OF THE AREA WITH SUITABLE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS THAT REQUIRE FIELD CONFIRMATION, WE ASSUME THAT THE SPECIES MAY HAVE 8 285 KM(2) OF DISTRIBUTION ON THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY WE LOCALIZED 7 ROOSTING AND NESTING AREAS OF THE SPECIES. THE AREA KNOWN AS CHORROS DEL VARAL, IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF LOS REYES IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IS ON THE BORDER LIMITS WITH JALISCO STATE AND COULD BE A CONTACT AREA BETWEEN MACAW POPULATIONS OF THE 2 STATES. THIS IS THE FIRST STATE LEVEL STUDY IN THE COUNTRY THAT COMBINES ACTUAL FIELD RECORDS AND ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELING TO ESTIMATE THE SPECIES ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION.","APARTADO POSTAL 70-233, MEXICO, D F 00000, MEXICO",NA,"TIBERIO@UMICH.MX",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","862FX",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1870-3453","REV.

ROOST COUNTS WERE UNDERTAKEN MONTHLY FROM SEPTEMBER 1996 TO SEPTEMBER 1998 TO DETERMINE MINIMUM POPULATION COUNTS AND TRENDS. RESULTS THE PARAKEETS WERE DISTRIBUTED IN THREE SUBPOPULATIONS: WEST OF LONDON, SOUTHEAST LONDON AND IN THANET, KENT. THE TOTAL POPULATION INCREASED DURING THE PERIOD, WITH LITTLE SPREAD, EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT WESTWARD RANGE EXPANSION. FLOCK SIZE DID NOT INCREASE, AND POPULATION GROWTH WAS ONLY APPARENT FROM MAXIMUM COUNTS AT COMMUNAL ROOSTS. THE ROOSTS WERE LARGEST IN THE EARLY AUTUMN WHEN, IN EACH OF THE THREE YEARS, MINIMUM TOTAL POPULATION COUNTS WERE OBTAINED. THE WEST OF LONDON POPULATION WAS LARGE AND GROWING, WHILE THE SOUTHEAST LONDON AND THANET POPULATIONS WERE SMALLER AND NOT INCREASING. THE YEARLY TOTAL POPULATION COUNTS WERE 1508, 1880 AND 2060.

WE REVIEW PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED SOURCES, COLLATING RECORDS FROM 61 LOCALITIES IN PERU, BRAZIL AND BOLIVIA, AND COMPILING INFORMATION ON HABITAT USE, SEASONALITY, GROUP SIZE, DEMOGRAPHY, AND POPULATION DENSITY. WE FIND THE SPECIES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH DISTURBED HABITATS AT ONE SITE, BUT A BROADER ANALYSIS REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS WITH FOREST TYPE, RIVERINE HABITATS, DEGREE OF DISTURBANCE OR ALTITUDE. BY MAPPING LOCALITY RECORDS, AND ACCOUNTING FOR DISCONTINUITIES, WE CALCULATE AN EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE OF 460,000 KM(2). RANGE-WIDE DATA ON ENCOUNTER RATES AND FLOCK SIZES SUGGEST THAT THE SPECIES IS SEDENTARY AND GREGARIOUS, WITH AN OVERALL POPULATION DENSITY OF ONE MATURE INDIVIDUAL PER 10-50 KM(2).

THE IMPORTANCE OF EACH FACTOR MAY VARY GEOGRAPHICALLY, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHERE A SPECIES WILL SPREAD. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE DISTRIBUTION OF MONK PARAKEETS (MYIOPSITTA MONACHUS), A PARROT NATIVE TO SOUTH AMERICA THAT HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE USE MONK PARAKEET OBSERVATIONS GATHERED FROM CITIZEN-SCIENCE DATASETS TO INFORM A SERIES OF RANDOM FOREST MODELS THAT EXAMINE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF BIOPHYSICAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC VARIABLES IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE FIND THAT WHILE THE DISTRIBUTION OF MONK PARAKEETS IN THE SOUTHERN US IS BEST EXPLAINED BY BIOPHYSICAL VARIABLES SUCH AS JANUARY DEW POINT TEMPERATURE AND FOREST COVER, THE DISTRIBUTION OF MONK PARAKEETS IN THE NORTHERN US APPEARS TO BE LIMITED TO URBAN ENVIRONMENTS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MONK PARAKEETS ARE UNLIKELY TO SPREAD OUTSIDE OF URBAN ENVIRONMENTS IN THE NORTHERN UNITED STATES, AS THEY ARE NOT ADAPTED TO THE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS IN THAT REGION. WE EXTEND THE NOTION OF ``SUBSTITUTABLE HABITATS,'' PREVIOUSLY APPLIED TO DIFFERENT HABITATS IN THE SAME LANDSCAPE, TO EXOTIC SPECIES IN NOVEL LANDSCAPES (E.G., CITIES). THESE NOVEL LANDSCAPES PROVIDE RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT, ALTHOUGH VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE SPECIES' NATIVE HABITAT, STILL ENABLE THEM TO BECOME ESTABLISHED. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE REGIONALLY-SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT ALLOW AN EXOTIC SPECIES TO BECOME ESTABLISHED, WHICH IS KEY TO PREDICTING THEIR EXPANSION BEYOND AREAS OF INTRODUCTION.","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,"EMINOR@UIC.EDU",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","302PZ","10.1007/s10530-013-0530-z",NA,NA,"1573-1464",NA,NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF); U.S. FOREST SERVICE UNDER THE ULTRA-EX PROGRAM (NSF) [0948484]","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE UNDER THE ULTRA-EX PROGRAM (NSF GRANT NUMBER 0948484).

WE USED THE MAXIMUM ENTROPY ALGORITHM (MAXENT) AND SPECIES HISTORICAL RECORDS. TO EXTERNALLY VALIDATE THE MODELS, WE USED PRESENCE AND ABSENCE RECORDS FROM FIELD OBSERVATIONS (2010-2012). TO CHARACTERIZE THE DISTRIBUTION AREA, WE USED THE VEGETATION AND LAND USE MAPS OF INEGI SERIES IV (2007-2010). THE MODELS SHOWED A GOOD PERFORMANCE, ACCORDING TO THE VALUES OF THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC), WHICH RANGED BETWEEN 0.88-0.95 WITH THE TRAINING DATA AND BETWEEN 0.82-0.91 WITH TEST DATA. WE LOCATED MOST OF THE SPECIES IN SITES WHERE THE MODELS PREDICTED THEIR PRESENCE. IN THE PENINSULA, OVER 76\% OF THE PARROTS' POTENTIAL GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION AREA IS FORESTED, EXCEPT FOR AMAZONA ORATRIX. THE SUBHUMID TROPICAL FOREST IS THE BEST REPRESENTED, AND THE LIVESTOCK FOR LAND USE. THE MOST AFFECTED SPECIES WITHIN THE PENINSULA ARE: AMAZONA FARINOSA AND A. ORATRIX. THE CALAKMUL BIOSPHERE RESERVE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA FOR PARROTS' PROTECTION IN THE PENINSULA.

THE PATTERNS OF DISTRIBUTION HAVE BEEN SHAPED BY HISTORICAL AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT PLAY DIFFERENT ROLES AT BOTH TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SCALES. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH WERE TO CHARACTERIZE THE HABITAT OF THE ENDANGERED MILITARY MACAW (ARA MILITARIS) AND EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SPECIES BASED ON TRENDS OF LAND USE CHANGES IN MEXICO. WE CHARACTERIZED THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND FLORISTIC COMPOSITION OF 8 FORESTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY USED BY THE MILITARY MACAW FOR BREEDING AND FEEDING AND COMPARED THE RESULTS WITH 6 SIMILAR FORESTS CHARACTERIZED IN OTHER STUDIES BUT WITHOUT HISTORICAL RECORDS OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MILITARY MACAW. THE MILITARY MACAW PREFERRED SITES WITH HIGH DIVERSITY OF PLANT SPECIES DOMINATED BY TREES FROM 4 TO 15 M IN HEIGHT AND FROM 5 TO 90 CM IN DIAMETER AT BREAST HEIGHT. WE IDENTIFIED 236 PLANT SPECIES IN THE 8 FORESTS WITH 20 SPECIES (8.4\%) USED FOR NESTING AND FEEDING BY THE MILITARY MACAW. THE FLORISTIC COMPOSITION IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE MILITARY MACAW BECAUSE THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORESTS WITH AND WITHOUT ITS PRESENCE. THE POTENTIAL AREA OF DISTRIBUTION OF THE MILITARY MACAW HAD DECREASED BY 32\% AND THE REMNANT AREAS ARE INCLUDED IN ONLY 8 NATIONAL PROTECTED AREAS. THE PROTECTED AREAS OF NATURAL FORESTS SHOULD BE INCREASED TO PRESERVE THE SITES OF POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION AND CONSEQUENTLY THE HABITAT OF THE MILITARY MACAW IN MEXICO.","APARTADO POSTAL 70-233, MEXICO, D F 00000, MEXICO",NA,"FRIVERA@CIECO.UNAM.MX",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","296CG","10.7550/rmb.34953",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CONACYTCONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA (CONACYT) [60270, DT006]","F.

THE HIGHEST DENSITIES OCCURRED IN ENDEMIC PALM AND MIXED FORESTS. HABITATS WITH A HIGH PROPORTION OF PALMS WERE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT PARROTS THAN HABITATS WITHOUT PALMS. AS NO PARROTS WERE DETECTED ON CURIEUSE THE NUMBER ESTIMATED ON PRASLIN IS THE GLOBAL WILD POPULATION. THE SMALL SIZE OF THIS POPULATION NECESSITATES ITS CATEGORIZATION AS VULNERABLE ON THE IUCN RED LIST. OUR MAIN RECOMMENDATION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF C. (N.)

WE COMPARED THE PROBABILITY WITH WHICH NINE PARROT SPECIES USE OLD-GROWTH AND SECONDARY FORESTS IN A SIMILAR TO 400 KM(2) AMAZONIAN LANDSCAPE, WHILE CONSIDERING TWO TYPES OF HABITAT USE: PERCHING AND FLYOVER USE. PERCHING USE, WHEN INDIVIDUALS STOP AT A SAMPLING SITE, IMPLIES RESTING, FORAGING, OR BREEDING ACTIVITIES; FLYOVER MERELY IMPLIES THAT PARROTS FLY THROUGH, ABOVE THE CANOPY AT A SITE. WE ESTABLISHED 155 SAMPLING SITES SPANNING OLD GROWTH AND APPROXIMATELY 30-YEAR-OLD SECONDARY FOREST, AND SAMPLED THEM REPEATEDLY USING AUTONOMOUS AUDIO RECORDERS. PERCHING AND FLYOVER USE WERE DISTINGUISHED BASED ON THE TEMPORAL VARIATION OF INTENSITY IN PARROT VOCALIZATION SONOGRAMS. WE MODELED OUR DATA WITH A SET OF SPECIES-SPECIFIC, MULTI-STATE OCCUPANCY MODELS THAT ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF EACH TYPE OF USE FOR BOTH HABITATS WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR IMPERFECT SPECIES DETECTION. MODELS WERE FIT IN A MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FRAMEWORK AND RANKED ACCORDING TO THE AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION. ALL BUT ONE SPECIES FLY OVER BOTH HABITATS WITH THE SAME PROBABILITY, WHILE SEVEN OUT OF NINE SHOW A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF PERCHING IN OLD GROWTH THAN IN SECONDARY FOREST. INTERSPECIFIC VARIATION IN RESPONSE TO HABITAT CHANGE WAS NOT EXPLAINED BY VARIATION IN BODY MASS OR RELATIVE BRAIN SIZE. AFTER THREE DECADES OF FOREST REGENERATION IN OUR STUDY AREA, THERE ARE STILL MEASURABLE DIFFERENCES IN HABITAT USE, WITH A BROAD TENDENCY FOR PARROTS TO FAVOR OLD GROWTH OVER SECONDARY FOREST.

COMBINING DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES CAN FILL GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DYNAMIC PROCESSES DRIVING CHANGES IN SPECIES-RICH, BUT DATA-POOR REGIONS. WE COMBINED RECENT BIRD SURVEY DATA FROM THE NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY MAPPING INITIATIVE (NEOMAPS) WITH HISTORICAL DISTRIBUTION RECORDS TO ESTIMATE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF EIGHT SPECIES OF AMAZON PARROTS IN VENEZUELA. USING ENVIRONMENTAL COVARIATES AND PRESENCE-ONLY DATA FROM MUSEUM COLLECTIONS AND THE LITERATURE, WE FIRST USED MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD TO FIT A SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODEL (SDM) ESTIMATING A HISTORICAL MAXIMUM PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE FOR EACH SPECIES. WE THEN USED RECENT, NEOMAPS SURVEY DATA TO BUILD SINGLE-SEASON OCCUPANCY MODELS (OM) WITH THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL COVARIATES, AS WELL AS WITH TIME- AND EFFORT-DEPENDENT DETECTABILITY, RESULTING IN ESTIMATES OF THE CURRENT PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE. WE FINALLY CALCULATED THE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN PREDICTIONS AS A MATRIX OF PROBABILITY OF CHANGE IN THE STATE OF OCCURRENCE. OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED NEGATIVE CHANGES FOR THE ONLY RESTRICTED, THREATENED SPECIES, AMAZONA BARBADENSIS, WHICH HAS BEEN INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED WITH FIELD STUDIES. TWO OF THE THREE REMAINING WIDESPREAD SPECIES THAT WERE DETECTED, AMAZONA AMAZONICA, AMAZONA OCHROCEPHALA, ALSO HAD A HIGH PROBABILITY OF NEGATIVE CHANGES IN NORTHERN VENEZUELA, BUT RESULTS WERE NOT CONCLUSIVE FOR AMAZONA FARINOSA. THE FOUR REMAINING SPECIES WERE UNDETECTED IN RECENT FIELD SURVEYS; THREE OF THESE WERE MOST PROBABLY ABSENT FROM THE SURVEY LOCATIONS (AMAZONA AUTUMNALIS, AMAZONA MERCENARIA AND AMAZONA FESTIVA), WHILE A FOURTH (AMAZONA DUFRESNIANA) REQUIRES MORE INTENSIVE TARGETED SAMPLING TO ESTIMATE ITS CURRENT STATUS. OUR APPROACH IS UNIQUE IN TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF AVAILABLE, BUT LIMITED DATA, AND IN DETECTING A HIGH PROBABILITY OF CHANGE EVEN FOR RARE AND PATCHILY-DISTRIBUTED SPECIES. HOWEVER, IT IS PRESENTLY LIMITED TO SPECIES MEETING THE STRONG ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRED FOR MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION WITH PRESENCE-ONLY DATA, INCLUDING VERY HIGH DETECTABILITY AND REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLING OF ITS HISTORICAL DISTRIBUTION.

WE ASSESSED HABITAT CONSERVATION TARGETS FOR THIS SPECIES AND ASKED, ``WHAT CONSTITUTES THE RIGHT TARGET?'' FOR SPECIES WITH SMALL RANGES, MAXIMIZING THE PROPORTION OF THE RANGE UNDER PROTECTION IS AN ESTABLISHED STRATEGY TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST THREATS. HOWEVER, DESIGNATING AN AMOUNT FOR PROTECTION BASED ON RANGE ALONE (I.E. A `REPRESENTATION TARGET') MAY SET A MISGUIDED CONSERVATION TARGET IF CRITICAL RESOURCES ARE NOT CONSIDERED. WE USED AN ENSEMBLE MODEL ('BIOMOD2') TO MAP SUITABLE BREEDING AND NONBREEDING HABITAT OF THE TUCUMAN PARROT BASED ON ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES AND KEY RESOURCES (BREEDING) OR THE SPECIES' OCCURRENCE (NONBREEDING). PINO BLANCO (PODOCARPUS PARLATOREI) SEEDS ARE CRITICAL FOOD FOR TUCUMAN PARROT NESTLINGS, SO WE MODELED THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS TREE AS A PROXY FOR POTENTIAL BREEDING HABITAT. WE THEN EXAMINED THE ADEQUACY OF CURRENT HABITAT PROTECTION RELATIVE TO REPRESENTATION TARGETS AND IN LIGHT OF KNOWN THREATS, INCLUDING FOREST DEGRADATION AND LOSS, AND POACHING. OVERALL, 17\% OF THE 110,122 KM 2 SOUTHERN YUNGAS IS PROTECTED, WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE PROPORTION RECOMMENDED (THE TARGET; 22\%), BASED ON THE ECOREGION'S SIZE, FOR INCLUSION IN A CONSERVATION NETWORK. SIMILARLY, 26\% OF THE 46,263 KM(2) OF NONBREEDING HABITAT IS PROTECTED, ALSO RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL AT 71\% OF THE TARGET (36\%). HOWEVER, OF THE SCANT SIMILAR TO 21,000 KM(2) OF BREEDING HABITAT, ONLY 15\% IS PROTECTED, MUCH LESS THAN THE REPRESENTATION TARGET (49\%) RECOMMENDED FOR MAXIMIZING THE PROBABILITY OF POPULATION PERSISTENCE. POACHING OF NESTLINGS FURTHER UNDERMINES THE VALUE OF SOME NESTING HABITAT IN BOLIVIA. FOR TUCUMAN PARROTS, INCREASED ENFORCEMENT OF PROTECTION IN BOLIVIA AND PROTECTION OF ADDITIONAL NESTING HABITAT IN ARGENTINA ARE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAYS TO ENHANCE PERSISTENCE. OUR RESULTS ILLUSTRATE HOW HABITAT CONSERVATION TARGETS BASED ON AREA ALONE MAY BE INADEQUATE IF IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION IS OVERLOOKED.","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",NA,"APIDGEON@WISC.EDU",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","CV4HT","10.1650/CONDOR-14-214.1",NA,NA,"1938-5129",NA,NA,"CONSERVATION LEADERSHIP PROGRAMME; LORO PARQUE FUNDACION; IDEA WILD; RUFFORD FOUNDATION SMALL GRANT; WHITLEY FUND FOR NATURE; WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY; OVERBROOK FOUNDATION; UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CONSERVATION LEADERSHIP PROGRAMME, LORO PARQUE FUNDACION, IDEA WILD, A RUFFORD FOUNDATION SMALL GRANT, THE WHITLEY FUND FOR NATURE, WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY, OVERBROOK FOUNDATION, AND BY THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON.

WE MODELLED ITS GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PREDICTING ITS HISTORICAL, CURRENT AND FUTURE (IN FACE OF CLIMATIC CHANGES) GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTIONS. WE ALSO TESTED THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SPECIES TRACKS SIMILAR ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS WHILE SEASONALLY MIGRATING. FINALLY, WE ESTIMATED THE OVERLAP BETWEEN ITS PREDICTED DISTRIBUTIONS AND THE CURRENT PROTECTED AREAS NETWORK. WE USED EIGHT MODELLING TECHNIQUES IN AN ENSEMBLE-FORECASTING APPROACH TO REACH CONSENSUS DISTRIBUTIONAL SCENARIOS. THE MODELLED HISTORICAL BREEDING AND WINTERING RANGES COVERED A LARGER AREA THAN TODAY. ITS CURRENT YEAR-ROUND DISTRIBUTION IS LOCATED IN THE SAME REGION AS BEFORE BUT DECREASED BY 13\%, WHEREAS THE BREEDING RANGE DECREASED BY 32\%, AND THE WINTERING RANGE BY 43\%. THE FUTURE YEAR-ROUND DISTRIBUTION IS PREDICTED TO DECREASE BY 47\% AND SHIFT TO EAST BY 2060. EVEN MORE DRASTIC DECREASES IN RANGE ARE PREDICTED FOR BREEDING (63\%) AND WINTERING (91\%) RANGES. THE NICHES OF THE BREEDING AND WINTERING DISTRIBUTIONS ARE GOOD PREDICTORS OF THE RECORDS OF THE OTHER SEASON. THE GREATEST VARIATION (SDS) IN THE PREDICTIONS COMES FROM MODELLING TOOLS AND GCMS, AND LITTLE FROM CLIMATIC SCENARIOS. HOWEVER, VARIATION IN PREDICTIONS WERE SMALL WITHIN HIGH PROBABILITY REGIONS FOR MODELLING TOOLS BY HIGHER EVERYWHERE FOR GCMS AND CLIMATIC SCENARIOS. THE RED-SPECTACLED AMAZON IS CURRENTLY UNDERREPRESENTED (<1\% OF YEAR-ROUND RANGE, AND <4\% OF EACH SEASONAL RANGE) IN THE CURRENT RESERVE SYSTEM. A BROAD VIEW OVER ALL ESTIMATED AND PREDICTED RANGES REVEALED THAT A SMALL PORTION OF THE RANGE HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN CURRENT AND FUTURE CONSERVATION ACTIONS FOR THIS BIRD - IN THE NORTHEAST PART OF STATE OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL AND SOUTHEAST STATE OF SANTA CATARINA, BRAZIL.

HOWEVER, THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES AND THEIR REQUIRED HABITATS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE IN TERMS OF ACCURACY AND AVAILABILITY ACROSS TAXA AND REGIONS, PARTICULARLY IN TROPICAL LANDSCAPES WHERE ACCESSIBILITY IS ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING. SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS (SDMS) PROVIDE PREDICTIVE TOOLS FOR ADDRESSING GAPS FOR POORLY SURVEYED SPECIES, BUT THEY RARELY CONSIDER BIASES IN GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF RECORDS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES.

THE PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE WAS SKEWED TOWARDS MORE ACCESSIBLE AREAS, MOSTLY SECONDARY ROADS. VARIABILITY IN OBSERVED OCCURRENCE PATTERNS WAS MOSTLY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE PURE EFFECT OF HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS (76.2\%), INDICATING THAT BIAS IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF OCCURRENCES DOES NOT INVALIDATE SPECIES-HABITAT RELATIONSHIPS DERIVED FROM NICHE MODELS. HOWEVER, OBSERVED SPATIAL COVARIATION BETWEEN LAND-USE AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE AND ACCESSIBILITY (JOINT CONTRIBUTION: 22.3\%) MAY CONFOUND THE INDEPENDENT ROLE OF LAND-USE IN THE SPECIES DISTRIBUTION.

ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS CAN BE USED TO PREDICT THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF AN INVASIVE SPECIES FROM OCCURRENCE RECORDS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATA LAYERS. WE USED THE ECOLOGICAL NICHE FACTOR ANALYSIS (ENFA), A PRESENCE-ONLY PREDICTIVE MODELLING APPROACH, TO DESCRIBE THE INVASIVE RING-NECKED PARAKEETS' REALIZED NICHE AND TO IDENTIFY AREAS SUITABLE FOR THE PARAKEET IN NORTHERN BELGIUM. ENFA PROVED TO BE A ROBUST AND RELIABLE MODELLING TECHNIQUE, ABLE TO GAUGE THE ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS OF AN INVASIVE SPECIES WITHOUT THE NEED TO INCLUDE HISTORICAL INFORMATION ON THE STARTING POINT OF THE INVASION. ENFA SHOWS THAT THE PARAKEETS TEND TO OCCUPY RELATIVELY RARE HABITATS COMPARED TO THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN NORTHERN BELGIUM, ALTHOUGH THEY SHOW SOME TOLERANCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS INSIDE PARKS AND FORESTS. THE GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE RING-NECKED PARAKEET IS GOVERNED PRIMARILY BY THE AMOUNT OF OLDER FOREST PATCHES, PARKS AND BUILT-UP AREA IN THE LANDSCAPE-REFLECTING THE PARAKEETS' NEED FOR SUITABLE NESTING CAVITIES AND ITS RELIANCE UPON URBAN AREAS TO FORAGE. OUR RESULTING HABITAT SUITABILITY MAPS SHOW THAT THE PARAKEETS HAVE AMPLE ROOM TO FURTHER INCREASE THEIR RANGE IN NORTHERN BELGIUM. OUR RESULTS INDICATE SOME CONCERN FOR INCREASED COMPETITION BETWEEN PARAKEETS AND THE NUTHATCHES, NATIVE CAVITY NESTERS KNOWN TO SUFFER FROM COMPETITION WITH PARAKEETS, AS SOME REGIONS KNOWN AS NUTHATCH STRONGHOLDS ARE HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE INVADED BY THE PARAKEETS.","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,"DIEDERIK.STRUBBE@UA.AC.BE",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","404CJ","10.1007/s10530-008-9266-6",NA,NA,"1573-1464",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1387-3547","BIOL.

IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THAT IT SHOWS ATTITUDINAL AND SEASONAL MIGRATIONS ALONG ITS DISTRIBUTIONAL RANGE, SUGGESTING THAT ITS ECOLOGICAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION IS STILL UNCERTAIN. WE MODELED THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE A. FINSCHI CONSIDERING THE TWO MAIN ACTIVITY SEASONS FOR THE SPECIES: REPRODUCTIVE AND NON-REPRODUCTIVE. WE USED 428 HISTORICAL OCCURRENCES (1882-2014), OBTAINED FROM OPEN ACCESS DATABASES, COMBINED WITH FIVE ENVIRONMENTAL LAYERS: THREE CLIMATIC AND TWO TOPOGRAPHIC FOR EACH SEASON, TO PERFORM ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS USING MAXENT. WE THEN TRANSFERRED EACH MODEL TO THE REST OF THE MONTHS TO ANALYZE THE SEASONAL MOVEMENTS GUIDED BY CLIMATE. DIFFERENCES IN ECOLOGICAL VARIABLES BETWEEN SEASONS WERE EVALUATED USING A T-TEST. THE GEOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE AMONG THE PARROT DISTRIBUTION AND THE RESOURCES (PLANTS) DISTRIBUTIONS WERE ANALYZED BY SUPERIMPOSING MAPS. A MARKED SEASONALITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF A. FINSCHI WAS OBSERVED. ECOLOGICALLY, THE SPECIES DISPLAYS GREATER AMPLITUDE DURING THE BREEDING SEASONS IN TERMS OF MINIMUM TEMPERATURE, BUT A NOTICEABLE REDUCTION AS FAR AS PRECIPITATION IS CONCERNED. THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD AND NESTING RESOURCES LARGELY CORRESPONDS TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS PARROT. THERE IS A WIDE AREA IN THE CENTER OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN WHICH THE SPECIES FINDS CONDITIONS THAT MEET BOTH PERIODS OF ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS TRANSITION CONDITIONS BETWEEN THESE PERIODS. FINALLY, OUR RESULTS ON THE SEASONAL VARIATION IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SPECIES, POSSESS A STRONG ECOLOGICAL MEANING IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF OTHER SPECIES DISTRIBUTION, PARTICULARLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHLY SEASONAL ENVIRONMENTS, AND DEFINITIVELY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSERVATION OF THIS SPECIES.","UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",NA,"ALEX-SB@HOTMAIL.COM QSANTIAGO@UV.MX OCTAVIO.ROJAS@INECOL.MX",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","FJ3HA","10.15517/rbt.v65i3.25417",NA,NA,"2215-2075",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0034-7744","REV.

ESTIMATING THEIR POPULATION SIZE AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE CAN BE PROBLEMATIC AND AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF CONSERVATION ASSESSMENTS. SCARCE DATA ON MOBILE SPECIES AND THE RESOURCES THEY NEED CAN ALSO LIMIT THE TYPE OF ANALYTICAL APPROACHES AVAILABLE TO DERIVE SUCH ESTIMATES. WE QUANTIFIED CHANGE IN AVAILABILITY AND USE OF KEY ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR BREEDING FOR A CRITICALLY ENDANGERED NOMADIC HABITAT SPECIALIST, THE SWIFT PARROT (LATHAMUS DISCOLOR). WE COMPARED ESTIMATES OF OCCUPIED HABITAT DERIVED FROM DYNAMIC PRESENCE-BACKGROUND (I.E., PRESENCE-ONLY DATA) CLIMATIC MODELS WITH ESTIMATES DERIVED FROM DYNAMIC OCCUPANCY MODELS THAT INCLUDED A DIRECT MEASURE OF FOOD AVAILABILITY. WE THEN COMPARED ESTIMATES THAT INCORPORATE FINE-RESOLUTION SPATIAL DATA ON THE AVAILABILITY OF KEY ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES (I.E., FUNCTIONAL HABITATS) WITH MORE COMMON APPROACHES THAT FOCUS ON BROADER CLIMATIC SUITABILITY OR VEGETATION COVER (DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF FINE-RESOLUTION DATA). THE OCCUPANCY MODELS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) SMALLER (UP TO AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE) AND MORE SPATIALLY DISCRETE ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL OCCUPIED AREA THAN CLIMATE-BASED MODELS. THE SPATIAL LOCATION AND EXTENT OF THE TOTAL AREA OCCUPIED WITH THE OCCUPANCY MODELS WAS HIGHLY VARIABLE BETWEEN YEARS (131 AND 1498 KM(2)). ESTIMATES ACCOUNTING FOR THE AREA OF FUNCTIONAL HABITATS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (2-58\% [SD 16]) THAN ESTIMATES BASED ONLY ON THE TOTAL AREA OCCUPIED. AN INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE AREA OF ONE FUNCTIONAL HABITAT (FORAGING OR NESTING) DID NOT NECESSARILY CORRESPOND TO AN INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE OTHER. THUS, AN INCREASE IN THE EXTENT OF OCCUPIED AREA MAY NOT EQUATE TO IMPROVED HABITAT QUALITY OR FUNCTION. WE ARGUE THESE PATTERNS ARE TYPICAL FOR MOBILE RESOURCE SPECIALISTS BUT OFTEN GO UNNOTICED BECAUSE OF LIMITED DATA OVER RELEVANT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES AND LACK OF SPATIAL DATA ON THE AVAILABILITY OF KEY RESOURCES.

WE CALCULATED THE FACTOR OF DISTRIBUTION CHANGE IN PRESENCES PREDICTED BY THE MODEL, AND GROUPED THE VARIABLES INTO EXPLANATORY FACTORS PERFORMING A VARIATION PARTITIONING TO ASSESS THE EXPLANATORY POWER OF EACH FACTOR. OUR MODEL INCLUDED SIX PREDICTORS TO EXPLAIN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF THE SPECIES. THESE PREDICTORS WERE GROUPED INTO THREE FACTORS: HUMAN ACTIVITY, CLIMATE, AND TOPOGRAPHY. PURELY HUMAN INFLUENCES ACCOUNTED FOR 63.8\% OF THE VARIATION OF THE FINAL MODEL, WHILE TOPOGRAPHICAL VARIABLES EXPLAINED 15.2\% AND CLIMATE ONLY 5.7\%. WE OBTAINED A HIGH DISTRIBUTION CHANGE FACTOR IN WHICH THE PRESENCES OF THE SPECIES WERE PREDICTED TO INCREASE BETWEEN TWO- AND SEVENFOLD. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HIGHLY FAVOURABLE SQUARES, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE SPECIES IS STILL ABSENT IN MORE THAN 72\% OF POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT AREAS, AND THUS WE EXPECT A CONTINUOUS INCREASE IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES. HUMAN ACTIVITY IS THE MAIN FORCE MOULDING THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES, AND LIES BEHIND ITS FAST EXPANSION, WHICH IS NOT ONLY ACTIVE, BUT IS ALSO PASSIVE VIA RELEASES AND ESCAPES.

SIMILARLY, THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OCCUPANCY (OR PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE) AND ABUNDANCE IS ALSO USUALLY ASSUMED TO BE POSITIVE AND IN MOST CASES CONSTANT. EXAMPLES OF AORS FOR NOMADIC SPECIES WITH VARIABLE DISTRIBUTIONS ARE EXTREMELY RARE. HERE WE EXAMINED TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL TRENDS IN THE AOR OVER 7 YEARS FOR A CRITICALLY ENDANGERED NOMADIC MIGRANT THAT RELIES ON DYNAMIC PULSES IN FOOD AVAILABILITY TO BREED. WE PREDICTED A NEGATIVE TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIP, WHERE LOCAL MEAN ABUNDANCES INCREASE WHEN THE NUMBER OF OCCUPIED SITES DECREASES, AND A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL ABUNDANCES AND THE PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE. WE ALSO PREDICTED THAT THESE PATTERNS ARE LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN FOOD ABUNDANCE. THE TEMPORAL AOR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE, AND ANNUAL FOOD AVAILABILITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE NUMBER OF OCCUPIED SITES BUT NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH ABUNDANCE. THUS, AS FOOD AVAILABILITY DECREASED, LOCAL DENSITIES OF BIRDS INCREASED, AND VICE VERSA. THE ABUNDANCE-PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE RELATIONSHIP WAS POSITIVE AND NONLINEAR BUT VARIED BETWEEN YEARS DUE TO DIFFERING DEGREES OF SPATIAL AGGREGATION CAUSED BY CHANGING FOOD AVAILABILITY. IMPORTANTLY, HIGH ABUNDANCE (OR OCCUPANCY) DID NOT NECESSARILY EQUATE TO HIGH-QUALITY HABITAT AND MAY BE INDICATIVE OF RESOURCE BOTTLENECKS OR EXPOSURE TO OTHER PROCESSES AFFECTING VITAL RATES.

ALTHOUGH SUCH SPECIES HAVE DECLINED IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD, FOR MOST ECOSYSTEMS THERE IS A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN THE POPULATION STATUS OF COMMON SPECIES. WE STUDIED THE ABUNDANCE OF COMMON, WIDESPREAD FOREST BIRDS IN NELSON LAKES NATIONAL PARK, NEW ZEALAND USING STANDARDISED 5-MIN BIRD COUNTS, CARRIED OUT OVER A 30-YEAR TIME SPAN. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BIRD COMMUNITY STRUCTURE DURING THIS PERIOD. FIVE NATIVE SPECIES (BELLBIRD, RIFLEMAN, GREY WARBLER, NEW ZEALAND TOMTIT AND TUI) DECLINED IN ABUNDANCE DURING THE 30 YEARS. ALL OF THESE DECLINED IN ABUNDANCE AT LOW BUT NOT HIGH ALTITUDES, AND THE DECLINE WAS SUBSTANTIAL FOR ALL BUT NEW ZEALAND TOMTIT AND TUI.

DURING FIELDWORK AT TWO LOWLAND STUDY SITES ON NEW BRITAIN BETWEEN DECEMBER 1998 AND APRIL 1999, GROUPS OF C.

MOREOVER, WHILE RECENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL RANGES MAY BE DIFFERENT, THE ROLE OF PROPAGULE ORIGIN IN INVASIONS HAS BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED. OUR AIM WAS TO DISENTANGLE THE RELATIVE ROLE OF NICHE REQUIREMENTS, PROPAGULE ORIGIN AND PROPAGULE PRESSURE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF AN INVASIVE BIRD SPECIES. LOCATION EUROPE, ASIA AND AFRICA. METHODS WE USED SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS, NICHE AND DEVIANCE PARTITIONING ANALYSES TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIVE ROLES OF PROPAGULE PRESSURE (INTERNATIONAL TRADE), ORIGIN OF INDIVIDUALS - (ASIAN OR AFRICAN), AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IN DETERMINING THE DISTRIBUTION OF INVASIVE RING-NECKED PARAKEETS ACROSS 25 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. RESULTS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NICHES OF NATIVE ASIAN AND AFRICAN PARAKEETS WERE FOUND, WITH THE ASIAN NICHE MATCHING THE EUROPEAN NICHE MORE CLOSELY. IN THE INVASIVE EUROPEAN RANGE, DISTRIBUTION OF PARAKEETS WAS MAINLY EXPLAINED BY THE PURE EFFECT OF YEAR OF FIRST IMPORTATION (AS A PROXY OF TIME SINCE FIRST INTRODUCTION), THE PURE EFFECT OF GEOGRAPHICAL ORIGIN OF PROPAGULES AND THE JOINT EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY AND YEAR OF FIRST IMPORTATION, BUT NOT BY OVERALL PROPAGULE PRESSURE. ONLY WHEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FRACTION OF INDIVIDUALS WHOSE NATIVE NICHE FITTED BETTER THE EUROPEAN CONDITIONS - ASIAN PARAKEETS - WAS THE ROLE OF PROPAGULE PRESSURE HIGHLIGHTED BY MODELS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS WHILE ENVIRONMENTAL-BASED PREDICTIONS CALIBRATED ON NATIVE RANGES CAN CONSTITUTE A USEFUL FIRST-SCREENING TOOL, INCORPORATING INFORMATION ABOUT PROPAGULE PRESSURE AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE VARIABILITY IN ITS GEOGRAPHICAL ORIGIN MAY RESULT IN A MUCH MORE THOROUGH ASSESSMENT OF INVASION RISK.

LOCATION SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA (27 DEGREES-37 DEGREES S LATITUDE AND 141 DEGREES-151 DEGREES E LONGITUDE). METHODS WE USED GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODELS (GAMS) TO MODEL TIME-SPECIFIC BIRD ATLAS OCCURRENCE DATA AGAINST TIME-SPECIFIC PLANT PRODUCTIVITY DATA, PLUS A RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PREDICTOR VARIABLES. WE THEN EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES ON THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL PATTERNS OF PREDICTED ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE SUPERB PARROT USING A CORRELATIVE MAPPING APPROACH. RESULTS KEY FINDINGS FROM GAM ANALYSIS WERE: (1) THERE WAS A STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ABUNDANCE AND PLANT PRODUCTIVITY IN ALL REGIONS, BUT (2) THE RESPONSE OF ABUNDANCE TO OTHER PREDICTOR VARIABLES OFTEN DIFFERED BETWEEN REGIONS. CORRELATIVE MAPPING PREDICTIONS OF THE ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE SUPERB PARROT ALSO INDICATED THAT: (1) PREDICTED ABUNDANCE VARIED THROUGH TIME AND SPACE, (2) PREDICTED ABUNDANCE SOMETIMES DECREASED IN ALL REGIONS, BUT AT OTHER TIMES SOME REGIONS HAD HIGH ABUNDANCE WHEN OTHERS HAD LOW, AND (3) CHANGES IN PLANT PRODUCTIVITY (AND THEREFORE CLIMATE) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS VARIATION. MAIN CONCLUSION THE SUPERB PARROT FAVOURS PRODUCTIVE LANDSCAPES THAT ARE ALSO FAVOURED FOR AGRICULTURE. MOVEMENTS APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SEASONAL AND YEAR TO YEAR CLIMATE VARIABILITY. THUS, VARIATION IN THE RECORDED ABUNDANCE OF THE SUPERB PARROT MAY MASK POPULATION TRENDS, SUGGESTING THAT EXISTING POPULATION ESTIMATES ARE UNRELIABLE. ALSO, HIGH ABUNDANCES IN SOME AREAS, AND AT SOME TIMES, MAY REFLECT DETERIORATING HABITAT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE RATHER THAN SPECIES RECOVERY. TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SUPERB PARROT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DROUGHT REFUGIA. CONSEQUENTLY, THROUGH TIME, AS KEY HABITAT CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE, THE SPECIES WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE AND THREATENED.

WE EVALUATED DIETARY STRATEGIES OF THE NORTHERN MEALY AMAZON IN A MODIFIED LANDSCAPE OF TROPICAL MOIST FOREST IN LOS CHIMALAPAS, MEXICO. WE ESTABLISHED 30 PHENOLOGY TRANSECTS (200X6M) TO DETERMINE FOOD RESOURCE AVAILABILITY IN PRIMARY EVERGREEN, RIPARIAN, AND SECONDARY FORESTS DURING THE PARROT BREEDING (MARCH-APRIL) AND NON-BREEDING (AUGUST-SEPTEMBER) SEASONS, AND DETERMINED PARROT DIET BY OBSERVATIONS OF FORAGING INDIVIDUALS. WE FOUND SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN FOOD RESOURCE AVAILABILITY, WITH SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FOOD RESOURCE AVAILABILITY IN THE BREEDING SEASON COMPARED TO THE NON-BREEDING SEASON, AND SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER RESOURCES IN SECONDARY FOREST. PARROTS CONSUMED MAINLY SEEDS OF A VARIETY OF PLANT SPECIES, AND PRESENTED A MEDIUM DIETARY NICHE DURING THE BREEDING SEASON. NEVERTHELESS, PARROTS FORAGED PREDOMINANTLY IN PRIMARY FOREST WHERE THEY DEMONSTRATED DIETARY SELECTIVITY, AND RARELY FORAGED IN SECONDARY FOREST WHERE THEY CONSUMED RESOURCES ACCORDING TO AVAILABILITY.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF IMPACT DUE TO COMPETITION COMES FROM WORK ON THE COMMON MYNA (ACRIDOTHERES TRISTIS).

IN ARGENTINA, PARTICULARLY IN THE PAMPAS REGION, AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION HAS RESULTED IN IMPORTANT CHANGES IN AGROECOSYSTEMS, WITH IMPACTS ON BIRD SPECIES. AIMS THIS STUDY ANALYSED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEST BIRD DENSITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH LAND USE AND/OR COVER, VEGETATION PRODUCTIVITY AND CLIMATE. THE STUDY FOCUSED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT PEST BIRD SPECIES TO GRAIN CROPS IN ARGENTINA AND URUGUAY: THE EARED DOVE (ZENAIDA AURICULATA) AND THE MONK PARAKEET (MYIOPSITTA MONACHUS). METHODS AN AREA IN CENTRAL ARGENTINA WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE AGRO-PRODUCTIVE REGIONS, ONE PREDOMINANTLY AGRICULTURAL AND TWO WITH MIXED PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES: AGRICULTURAL RANGELAND AND AGRICULTURAL FORESTED RANGELAND. BIRD POPULATIONS WERE SAMPLED ON A YEARLY BASIS BETWEEN 2003 AND 2011 IN POINT-TRANSECTS LOCATED ALONG SECONDARY ROADS (47 ROUTES IN TOTAL). LINEAR MIXED MODELS AND A MULTI-MODEL INFERENCE APPROACH WERE USED TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL PREDICTIVE VARIABLES ON BIRD DENSITIES. KEY RESULTS MEAN ESTIMATED DENSITY FOR THE EARED DOVE WAS 0.39 INDIVIDUALS PER HA (0.02), ALMOST THREE TIMES THE DENSITY OF THE MONK PARAKEET (0.10 INDIVIDUALS PER HA0.02). THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF CHANGES IN DENSITY OF THE EARED DOVE AND MONK PARAKEET SHOWED IRREGULAR PATTERNS ACROSS THE STUDY AREA. DENSITY OF EARED DOVE WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO COVER OF NATIVE AND EXOTIC WOODLOTS AND INVERSELY RELATED TO COVER OF FALLOW AND WEEDY FIELDS, AND TO TEMPERATURE AND RAINFALL. MONK PARAKEET DENSITY, IN TURN, WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO COVER OF WOODLOTS. CONCLUSIONS THE DENSITY OF EARED DOVES AND MONK PARAKEETS CHANGED MOSTLY IN RELATION TO LAND USE AND/OR COVER AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, TO CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. INFORMATION OF PEST BIRD POPULATIONS IN A LONG-TERM PERIOD ALLOWED US TO UNDERSTAND SPATIAL PATTERNS IN BIRD POPULATION DISTRIBUTION AND TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS EXPLAINING THEM.

THE STUDY OF THE VARIABLES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE SPECIES WITHIN URBAN HABITATS SHOULD ALLOW TO PREDICT WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES ARE INDICATIVE OF PREFERRED HABITAT, AND TO DESIGN LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE THESE AREAS LESS CONDUCIVE TO THESE SPECIES. THE MONK PARAKEET MYIOPSITTA MONACHUS IS AN INVASIVE SPECIES IN MANY AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND CITIES ARE ONE OF ITS MOST USUAL HABITATS IN INVADED AREAS. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER WAS TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN FACTORS THAT DETERMINE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MONK PARAKEET IN BARCELONA, ONE OF THE CITIES IN THE WORLD WITH THE HIGHEST PARAKEET DENSITY. WE DEFINED OUR MODEL BASED ON EIGHT PRESELECTED VARIABLES USING A GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL (GLZ) AND EVALUATED THE STRENGTH OF SUPPORT FOR EACH MODEL USING THE AIC-BASED MULTI-MODEL INFERENCE APPROACH. WE USED PARAKEET DENSITY AS A DEPENDENT VARIABLE, AND AN ANALYSIS RESTRICTED TO OCCUPIED NEIGHBOURHOODS PROVIDED A MODEL WITH TWO KEY VARIABLES TO EXPLAIN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES. MONK PARAKEETS WERE MORE ABUNDANT IN NEIGHBOURHOODS WITH A HIGH DENSITY OF TREES AND A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE OVER 65 YEARS. THIS IS INTERPRETED BY THE FACT THAT PARAKEETS USE TREES AS FOOD SOURCES AND SUPPORT FOR THE NESTS, AND THAT OLDER PEOPLE OFTEN FEED THE SPECIES. DATA SUPPORT THE `HUMAN-ACTIVITY' HYPOTHESIS TO EXPLAIN HOW INVASIVE SPECIES CAN SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISH IN A NON-NATIVE HABITAT, AND STRESS HOW LIMITING FOOD RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY FOOD SUPPLIED BY HUMANS, MAY BE THE EASIEST WAY TO EXERT SOME CONTROL ON MONK PARAKEET POPULATIONS.","PASSEIG PICASSO S-N, PARC CIUTADELLA, BARCELONA, E-08003, SPAIN",NA,"RUTH.R.PASTOR@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","988JA",NA,NA,NA,"2014-928X",NA,NA,"BARCELONA PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY (ASPB); MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND INNOVATION, SPANISH RESEARCH COUNCIL [CGL2009-10652]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE BARCELONA PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY (ASPB), AND BY RESEARCH PROJECT CGL2009-10652, MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND INNOVATION, SPANISH RESEARCH COUNCIL.

WE RELATED SPECIES CHARACTERISTICS TO CLAYLICK USE AND EXAMINED HOW PARROT ASSEMBLAGES USING CLAYLICKS CHANGED WITH DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRE OF CLAYLICK DISTRIBUTION. FIFTY-TWO PARROT CLAYLICKS WERE REPORTED FROM AN AREA OF CA 4 MILLION KM2 BUT OVER 50\% WERE RESTRICTED TO A 35 000 KM2 REGION OF SOUTHEAST PERU AND NORTHERN BOLIVIA. CLAYLICKS WERE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH MOIST FOREST ON YOUNGER (< 65 MILLIONS OF YR) GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS AND EXPOSED RIVER BANKS. THE PREDICTIVE MODEL OF CLAYLICK DISTRIBUTION MATCHED OUR REPORTED RANGE WELL, WITH PRECIPITATION OF WARMEST QUARTER, LAND COVER, TEMPERATURE SEASONALITY, AND DISTANCE FROM THE OCEAN BEING MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTORS OF CLAYLICK PRESENCE. TWENTY-SIX OF THE REGION'S 46 PARROT SPECIES VISITED CLAYLICKS. SPECIES DIFFERED GREATLY IN THEIR LICK USE, BUT BODY SIZE, DIETARY BREADTH, ABUNDANCE AND OTHER TRAITS WERE POOR PREDICTORS OF LICK USE. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR SURVEY IDENTIFIED THE DISTRIBUTION OF MAJOR PARROT CLAYLICKS IN SOUTH AMERICA, ALTHOUGH LESS CONSPICUOUS PARROT GEOPHAGY MAY OCCUR ELSEWHERE.

WE MEASURED BIRD ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES TURNOVER DURING THE MEDIUM TERM ( 13 AND 22 YEARS) AFTER INTENSIVE ALTERNATE-COUPE LOGGING IN A FOREST AREA THAT HAD BEEN STUDIED PREVIOUSLY FOR SHORT-TERM ( 0 - 4 YEARS) IMPACTS. THE STUDY PROVIDES A SERIES OF SNAPSHOTS OF BIRD POPULATION RECOVERY FOLLOWING ONE OF THE MOST INTENSIVE LOGGING OPERATIONS IN THE REGION WHEN, UNLIKE THE CURRENT PRACTICE, NO OLD TREES WERE RETAINED IN LOGGED AREAS AND NO UNLOGGED FOREST WAS RETAINED IN STRIPS ALONG ALL DRAINAGE LINES. THE AIM WAS TO ASSESS THE LONGER-TERM EFFECTS OF LOGGING ON THE BIRD ASSEMBLAGE AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER RECOVERY HAD OCCURRED. WE FOUND THAT RECOVERY HAD OCCURRED FOR A LARGE COMPONENT OF THE AVIFAUNA WITHIN 22 YEARS OF INTENSIVE LOGGING ( AS PRACTISED IN 1976 WHEN FEW OR NO OLD TREES WERE RETAINED IN LOGGED AREAS). MOST BIRD SPECIES THAT FORAGE AMONG CANOPY FOLIAGE, IN THE AIR, AMONG THE UNDERSTOREY AND ON THE GROUND HAD RECOVERED. FIVE COMMON FOREST BIRDS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMMON ON LOGGED COUPES THAN UNLOGGED COUPES. THE BELL MINER, MANORINA MELANOPHRYS, A HONEYEATER OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH DISTURBED FOREST AND IMPLICATED IN EUCALYPT CANOPY DIEBACK, HAD ESTABLISHED COLONIES ON SOME LOGGED COUPES 22 YEARS AFTER INTENSIVE LOGGING. HOWEVER, SOME HOLLOW-NESTING BIRD SPECIES (E.G. TREECREEPERS, COCKATOOS) HAD STILL NOT FULLY RECOVERED. A NUMBER OF OTHER COMMON FOREST BIRDS OCCURRED SO RARELY IN THE STUDY AREA ( ON BOTH LOGGED AND UNLOGGED COUPES) THAT FEW CONCLUSIONS COULD BE MADE ABOUT THEIR RESPONSES TO LOGGING. EVIDENCE SUGGESTED THAT INTENSIVE LOGGING MAY HAVE HAD AN EFFECT AT A LOCAL LANDSCAPE ( COMPARTMENT) LEVEL AS WELL AS AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL LOGGED COUPES.

THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THE RESULTS OF BYM DATA COLLECTED IN A MONTHLY REGULAR FIELD EFFORT FROM JULY 2001 TO JUNE 2005 AT THE RPPN SESC PANTANAL RESERVE (MATO GROSSO STATE, BRAZIL). THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE BYM'S USE OF THE RESERVE RESOURCES, ITS DISPLACEMENTS AND POSSIBLE CAUSES. EVERY OBSERVED BYM FLOCK OR INDIVIDUAL HAD ITS DATE, HOUR, GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES, FLOCK SIZE, AND ACTIVITY (LANDED, FEEDING, OR DISPLACEMENT) REGISTERED. THE FLIGHT AZIMUTH OF CONTINUOUS AND STRAIGHT DISPLACEMENTS WAS ALSO REGISTERED. WE USED CIRCULAR STATISTICS AND VECTOR PAIRS (AZIMUTH AND FLOCK SIZE) TO ANALYZE THE OBSERVED INTRADAY, MONTHLY, AND YEARLY DISPLACEMENTS PATTERN. A TOTAL OF 189 FLOCKS AND 854 BYM WERE RECORDED, THE AVERAGE SIZE BEING 4.5 +/- 3.7 INDIVIDUALS PER FLOCK. THE PREVALENT ACTIVITY CATEGORY WAS DISPLACEMENT (85.2 +/- 3.8\%) AND THE FLOCKS OCCURRED WITH NON-UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE YEAR. SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF ALL FLOCKS WERE REGISTERED IN ONLY 4 MONTHS, EACH ONE WITH A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WELL-DEFINED FLIGHT BEARING DIRECTION PATTERN.

WE FOCUS ON THREE SPECIES OF RESOURCE SPECIALISTS (CROSSBILL LOXIA FINCHES) TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF CLIMATE IN DETERMINING THE SEASONAL AVAILABILITY OF THEIR FOOD, THE IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE AND THE OCCURRENCE OF THEIR FOOD PLANTS FOR EXPLAINING THEIR CURRENT DISTRIBUTIONS, AND TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS. LOCATION: EUROPE. METHODS: WE USED DATASETS ON THE TIMING OF SEED FALL IN EUROPEAN SCOTS PINE PINUS SYLVESTRIS FORESTS (WHERE DIFFERENT CROSSBILL SPECIES OCCUR) TO ESTIMATE SEED FALL PHENOLOGY AND CLIMATE DATA TO DETERMINE ITS INFLUENCE ON SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE TIMING OF SEED FALL TO PROVIDE A LINK BETWEEN CLIMATE AND SEED SCARCITY FOR CROSSBILLS. WE USED LARGE-SCALE DATASETS ON CROSSBILL DISTRIBUTION, COVER OF THE CONIFERS RELIED ON BY THE THREE CROSSBILL SPECIES AND CLIMATE VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH TIMING OF SEED FALL, TO ASSESS THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE FOR PREDICTING CROSSBILL DISTRIBUTIONS. WE USED SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELLING TO PREDICT CHANGES IN THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS FOR 2070. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT SEED FALL OCCURRED 1.5-2 MONTHS EARLIER IN SOUTHERN EUROPE THAN IN SWEDEN AND SCOTLAND AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIATION IN SPRING MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES AND PRECIPITATION.

HOWEVER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE VARIABLES INTERACT WITH VARIABLES THAT OPERATE AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE, AND WHETHER THERE IS A HIERARCHY AMONG THE DIFFERENT SCALES THAT INFLUENCES NEST-SITE SELECTION, IS UNKNOWN. THIS INTERACTION COULD BE CRUCIAL IN BURROWING BIRDS, WHICH DEPEND HEAVILY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE NESTING LOCATIONS. ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS GROUP IS THE BURROWING PARROT, CYANOLISEUS PATAGONUS THAT BREEDS ON SPECIFIC RAVINES AND FORMS LARGE BREEDING COLONIES. AT A PARTICULAR SITE, BREEDING AGGREGATIONS REQUIRE THE CONCENTRATION OF ADEQUATE ENVIRONMENTAL ELEMENTS FOR CAVITY NESTING, WHICH ARE PROVIDED BY WITHIN RAVINE CHARACTERISTICS. THEREFORE, INTRINSIC RAVINE CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING NEST SITE SELECTION COMPARED TO LANDSCAPE LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS. HERE, WE ASSESS THIS HYPOTHESIS BY COMPARING THE IMPORTANCE OF RAVINE CHARACTERISTICS OPERATING AT DIFFERENT SCALES ON NEST-SITE SELECTION AND THEIR INTERRELATION WITH REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. WE QUANTIFIED 12 CHARACTERISTICS OF 105 RAVINES IN THEIR REPRODUCTIVE HABITAT. FOR EACH RAVINE WE QUANTIFIED MORPHOLOGICAL VARIABLES, DISTANCE TO RESOURCES AND DISTURBANCE AS WELL AS NEST NUMBER AND EGG PRODUCTION IN ORDER TO COMPARE SELECTED AND NON-SELECTED RAVINES AND DETERMINE THE INTERRELATIONSHIP AMONG VARIABLES IN EXPLAINING RAVINE DIFFERENCES. IN ADDITION, THE NUMBER OF NESTS AND EGG PRODUCTION FOR EACH REPRODUCTIVE RAVINE WAS RELATED TO RAVINE CHARACTERISTICS TO ASSESS THEIR RELATION TO REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NON-REPRODUCTIVE AND REPRODUCTIVE RAVINES IN BOTH INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT OF VARIATION BETWEEN RAVINES, HOWEVER, SHOWS THAT DIFFERENCES ARE MAINLY RELATED TO INTRINSIC MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS FOLLOWED BY EXTRINSIC VARIABLES ASSOCIATED TO HUMAN DISTURBANCE. LIKEWISE, WITHIN REPRODUCTIVE RAVINES, INTRINSIC CHARACTERISTICS ARE MORE STRONGLY RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF NESTS. THE PROBABILITY OF PRODUCING EGGS, HOWEVER, WAS RELATED ONLY TO DISTANCE TO ROADS AND HUMAN SETTLEMENTS, PATTERNS SUGGEST THAT C. PATAGONUS MAINLY SELECTS NESTING SITES BASED ON INTRINSIC MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RAVINES. SCALE DIFFERENCES IN THE IMPORTANCE OF RAVINE CHARACTERISTICS COULD BE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE PARTICULAR OROGRAPHY OF THE BREEDING HABITAT. THE ARRANGEMENT OF RESOURCES IS ASSOCIATED TO THE LOCATION OF THE GULLIES RATHER THAN TO INDIVIDUAL RAVINES, DETERMINING THE SPATIAL AVAILABILITY AND DISPOSITION OF RESOURCES AND DISTURBANCES. THUS, NEST SELECTION IS INFLUENCED BY INTRINSIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAXIMIZE THE FITNESS OF INDIVIDUALS.

ONE HUNDRED AND NINE SPECIES OF NON-PASSERINES HAVE BEEN RECORDED FROM THE WHEATBELT AND 34 (31\%) HAVE DECREASED IN RANGE AND/OR ABUNDANCE AND 9 (8\%) HAVE INCREASED, ONLY TWO OF THESE SPECIES OCCURRED IN THE WHEATBELT PRIOR TO THE CLEARING OF NATIVE VEGETATION. THE PASSERINES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED MORE BY CHANGING LAND USE WITH 62 (75\%) SPECIES DECREASING IN RANGE AND/OR ABUNDANCE AND NO SPECIES INCREASING. THE NEED TO OBTAIN MORE DATA ON POPULATION DYNAMICS, MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND RESOURCE USE OF NATIVE BIRDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF CONSERVATION SIGNIFICANCE, IS POINTED OUT, AS IS THE NEED TO INVOLVE THE HUMAN COMMUNITY IN THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND THE MONITORING OF THE NATIVE BIOTA. THE METHODS DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER USING OBSERVERS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WHEATBELT OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA HAVE WIDE APPLICATION IN ASSESSING THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF BIRDS AND OTHER ORGANISMS IN MANY OTHER AREAS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-26","LF320","10.1016/0006-3207(93)90322-R",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-3207","BIOL.

NULL MODELS PROVIDE A SOLUTION BUT ARE RARELY USED IN THIS FIELD. WE IMPLEMENTED AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION TO EXISTING NULL MODEL TESTS, EVALUATING NULL MODELS WITH THE SAME WITHHELD RECORDS THAT WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE REAL MODEL. WE BUILT AND EVALUATED MODELS ACROSS A RANGE OF MODELLING SCENARIOS AND FOR VARIOUS PERFORMANCE MEASURES USING THE ALGORITHM MAXENT AND THE MONK PARAKEET (MYIOPSITTA MONACHUS). LOCATION NATIVE RANGE IN SOUTHERN AMERICA AND GLOBAL INVASIONS PREDOMINANTLY IN NORTH/CENTRAL AMERICA AND EUROPE. METHODS WE TESTED THE ABILITY OF MODELS BUILT UNDER 15 SCENARIOS (FIVE SETS OF CALIBRATION RECORDS AND THREE SETTINGS THAT VARIED THE LEVEL OF MODEL COMPLEXITY) TO PREDICT SPATIALLY INDEPENDENT EVALUATION DATA IN THE INVADED RANGE (IN EFFECT, TESTING THE MODELS UNDER SPATIAL TRANSFER). WE QUANTIFIED PERFORMANCE WITH MEASURES OF DISCRIMINATORY ABILITY AND OVERFITTING BASED ON AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (AUC) AND THE OMISSION ERROR RATE. WE ESTIMATED NULL DISTRIBUTIONS OF THESE MEASURES AND CALCULATED EFFECT SIZE AND SIGNIFICANCE. WE DETERMINED HOW THESE ESTIMATES VARIED ACROSS MODELLING SCENARIOS, COMPARING WITH TWO TESTS EXISTING IN THE LITERATURE. RESULTS PERFORMANCE VARIED STARKLY ACROSS MODELLING SCENARIOS. AS EXPECTED, THE MEASURES OF OVERFITTING AGREED WITH EACH OTHER AND PROVIDED DIFFERENT INFORMATION THAN THAT OF DISCRIMINATORY ABILITY. HOWEVER, HIGH PERFORMANCE PER SE DID NOT SHOW STRONG ASSOCIATION WITH HIGH EFFECT SIZE AND SIGNIFICANCE. MAIN CONCLUSIONS ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS SHOULD BE ASSESSED WITH MEASURES OF EFFECT SIZE AND SIGNIFICANCE BASED ON APPROPRIATE NULL DISTRIBUTIONS, IN CONTRAST TO SEVERAL APPROACHES EXISTING IN THE LITERATURE.

WE APPLIED GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR RULE SET PREDICTION (GARP) ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELING, USING FIELD-SURVEY PRESENCE DATA TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL CURRENT DISTRIBUTION OF EACH SPECIES, AND INCORPORATED ABSENCE DATA TO DELINEATE EXTIRPATION AREAS. ALL PARROT SPECIES SHOWED A REDUCED CURRENT DISTRIBUTION, RANGING FROM 9.6 TO 79\% REDUCTION OF ESTIMATED ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION. THE THREATENED AND ENDEMIC SPECIES OF AMAZONA ORATRIX, AMAZONA FINSCHI, AND FORPUS CYANOPYGIUS SUFFERED THE GREATEST DISTRIBUTION REDUCTION, HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED BY HABITAT-BASED MODELS, SUGGESTING THAT CAPTURE FOR TRADE MAY HAVE CAUSED EXTIRPATION OF THESE SPECIES. THE GREATEST EXTENT OF CURRENT DISTRIBUTION WAS OCCUPIED BY ARATINGA CANICULARIS, AMAZONA ALBIFRONS AND ARA MILITARIS, WHICH CONTINUE TO OCCUR THROUGHOUT MOST OF THEIR ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION. AMAZONA AUROPALLIATA, ARATINGA STRENUA, AND BROTOGERIS JUGULARIS ALSO OCCUR THROUGHOUT THEIR RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION IN COASTAL CHIAPAS, AND SHOW A RELATIVELY SMALL DISTRIBUTION REDUCTION, BUT HAD THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF MODIFIED LANDS WITHIN THEIR CURRENT DISTRIBUTIONS.

HERE, WE USED CORRELATIVE ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS TO ASSESS POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTIONAL RESPONSES OF 3 RANGE-RESTRICTED WEST AFRICAN BIRDS, TIMNEH PARROT (PSCITTACUS ERITHRACUS TIMNEH), BALLMAN'S MALIMBE (MALIMBUS BALIMANNI), AND WHITE-NECKED ROCKFOWL (PICATHARTES GYMNOCEPHALUS), TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.

WE FOUND BROAD PRESENT-DAY POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO CLIMATE FOR ALL 3 SPECIES. FUTURE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BALLMAN'S MALIMBE AND WHITE-NECKED ROCKFOWL TENDED TO BE STABLE AND CLOSELY SIMILAR TO THEIR PRESENT-DAY DISTRIBUTIONS; BY CONTRAST, WE FOUND MARKED CLIMATE CHANGE-DRIVEN POTENTIAL RANGE LOSS ACROSS THE RANGE OF TIMNEH PARROT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE PRESENT DISTRIBUTIONS OF WEST AFRICAN BIRDS WILL IN SOME CASES BE MINIMAL, BUT THAT INDIVIDUAL SPECIES MAY RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO FUTURE CONDITIONS. THUS, TO OPTIMIZE CONSERVATION OF THESE SPECIES, AND OF BIRD DIVERSITY IN GENERAL, WE RECOMMEND THAT REGIONAL-TO-NATIONAL SPECIES CONSERVATION ACTION PLANS INCORPORATE CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR INDIVIDUAL SPECIES; ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS COULD PROVIDE AN INFORMATIVE BASELINE INFORMATION FOR THIS PLANNING AND PRIORITIZATION.","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","DUZ012","BENEDICTUSFREEMAN@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","IM2EN","10.1093/condor/duz012",NA,NA,"1938-5129",NA,NA," [GEF-5810]","B.

BOTH SPECIES ARE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED DUE TO LOGGING, AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXPECTED TO FURTHER REDUCE THEIR AVAILABLE HABITAT. OUR OBJECTIVES WERE TO ASSESS THE PRESENT AND FUTURE AVAILABILITY OF A SUITABLE HABITAT FOR THESE PARROTS USING ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS. FUTURE CLIMATIC SCENARIOS WERE ESTIMATED BY OVERLAYING THE PRESENT DISTRIBUTIONS OF THESE PARROTS ON MAPS OF PROJECTED BIOME DISTRIBUTIONS GENERATED USING A NORTH AMERICAN VEGETATION MODEL. OUR CLIMATIC SCENARIOS REVEALED THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF KEY HABITATS FOR BOTH PARROTS WILL LIKELY BE AFFECTED AS THE CLIMATE BECOMES MORE SUITABLE FOR XERIC BIOMES. THE CLIMATE ASSOCIATED WITH CONIFEROUS FORESTS IN THE CURRENT RANGE OF MAROON-FRONTED PARROTS IS PREDICTED TO DISAPPEAR BY 2090, AND THE CLIMATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE KEY CONIFEROUS HABITATS OF THICK-BILLED PARROTS MAY CONTRACT. HOWEVER, OUR RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT SUITABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL FOR THE HIGH-ELEVATION CONIFEROUS BIOMES WHERE THICK-BILLED PARROTS NEST. THE DEGREE TO WHICH BOTH SPECIES OF PARROTS WILL BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO THE NEW SCENARIOS IS UNCERTAIN. SOME OF THEIR LIFE HISTORY TRAITS MAY ALLOW THEM TO RESPOND WITH A COMBINATION OF ADAPTIVE AND SPATIAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATIC CHANGE AND, IN ADDITION, SUITABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL IN SOME PORTIONS OF THEIR RANGES. ACTIONS NEEDED TO ENSURE THE CONSERVATION OF THESE PARROTS INCLUDE STRICT CONTROL OF LOGGING AND INTEGRATION OF RAPID RESPONSE TEAMS FOR FIRE MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE POTENTIAL FORAGING RANGES OF NESTING PAIRS. A LANDSCAPE WITH A GREATER PROPORTION OF RESTORED FORESTS WOULD ALSO AID IN THE RECOVERY OF CURRENT POPULATIONS OF THICK-BILLED AND MAROON-FRONTED PARROTS AND FACILITATE THEIR RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. RESUMEN DISPONIBILIDAD DEL HABITAT ACTUAL Y FUTURO PARA LA COTORRA SERRANA OCCIDENTAL Y COTORRA SERRANA ORIENTAL EN LOS BOSQUES DEL NORTE DE MEXICO LA COTORRA SERRANA OCCIDENTAL (RHYNCHOPSITTA PACHYRHYNCHA) Y LA COTORRA SERRANA ORIENTAL (RHYNCHOPSITTA TERRISI) SON LOS UNICOS PSITACIDOS MEXICANOS ESPECIALIZADOS A LOS BOSQUES DE CONIFERAS DE MONTANA. AMBAS ESPECIES ESTAN EN PELIGRO CRITICO DEBIDO A LA TALA Y, ADEMAS SE ANTICIPA QUE EL CAMBIO CLIMATICO REDUCIRA MAS SUS HABITATS DISPONIBLES. NUESTROS OBJETIVOS FUERON EVALUAR LA DISPONIBILIDAD ACTUAL Y FUTURA DE HABITAT EN SUS DISTRIBUCIONES UTILIZANDO MODELOS DE NICHO ECOLOGICO. LOS ESCENARIOS DE CAMBIO CLIMATICO DEL FUTURO SE GENERARON MEDIANTE LA SOBREPOSICION DE LAS DISTRIBUCIONES ACTUALES DE LAS COTORRAS SOBRE LOS MAPAS DE LAS DISTRIBUCIONES DE BIOMAS GENERADOS EN UN MODELOS DE VEGETACION PARA NORTE AMERICA. NUESTROS ESCENARIOS CLIMATICOS REVELARON QUE LA DISTRIBUCION DE HABITATS CLAVE PARA AMBAS COTORRAS MUY POSIBLEMENTE SERA AFECTADA AL TORNARSE EL CLIMA MAS PROPICIO PARA BIOMAS XERICOS. EL CLIMA ASOCIADO A LOS BOSQUES DE CONIFERAS DENTRO DE LA DISTRIBUCION ACTUAL DE LA COTORRA SERRANA ORIENTAL SE ESTIMA DESAPARECERA PARA 2090, Y EL CLIMA ASOCIADO A LOS BOSQUES DE CONIFERAS CLAVES ASOCIADO A LA DISTRIBUCION DE LA COTORRA SERRANA OCCIDENTAL SUFRIRA UNA CONTRACCION. SIN EMBARGO, NUESTROS RESULTADOS TAMBIEN INDICAN QUE CONDICIONES CLIMATICAS APTAS PREVALECERAN PARA LAS AREAS MAS ELEVADAS DE BIOMAS DE CONIFERAS DONDE LA COTORRA SERRANA OCCIDENTAL ANIDA. EL GRADO AL CUAL AMBAS ESPECIES DE COTORRAS SERAN CAPACES DE ADAPTARSE A LOS NUEVOS ESCENARIOS ES INCIERTO. ALGUNOS DE SUS RASGOS DE VIDA LES PUEDEN AYUDAR A RESPONDER CON UNA COMBINACION DE RESPUESTA ADAPTATIVA Y ESPECIALMENTE AL CAMBIO CLIMATICO Y, ADEMAS, CONDICIONES CLIMATICAS APTAS PREVALECERAN EN ALGUNAS AREAS DE SUS DISTRIBUCIONES. ACCIONES NECESARIAS PARA ASEGURAR LA CONSERVACION DE AMBAS COTORRAS INCLUYEN EL CONTROL ESTRICTO DE TALA Y LA INTEGRACION DE EQUIPOS DE RESPUESTA RAPIDA PARA LA SUPRESION Y CONTROL DE INCENDIOS DENTRO DE LAS AREAS DE ALIMENTACION CUANDO LAS PAREJAS ANIDAN. UN PAISAJE CON MAYOR PROPORCION DE BOSQUES RESTAURADOS CONTRIBUIRA A UNA RECUPERACION CONTEMPORANEA DE LAS POBLACIONES DE COTORRA SERRANA OCCIDENTAL Y COTORRA SERRANA ORIENTAL Y FACILITARA SUS RESPUESTAS AL CAMBIO CLIMATICO.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"TMONTER2002@YAHOO.COM.MX",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","CC4VS","10.1111/jofo.12084",NA,NA,"1557-9263",NA,NA,"COORDINACION PARA LA INVESTIGACION CIENTIFICA AT UMSNH; CONACYT INSTITUTO TECNOLOGICO Y DE ESTUDIOS SUPERIORES DE MONTERREY BASES DE DATOS SNIB-CONABIO PROYECTOS [K16 Y Q50]; PROJECT ``ECOLOGIA Y SITUACION ACTUAL DE LAS ESPECIES PRIORITARIAS DE PSITACIDOS EN LA VERTIENTE DEL PACIFICO MEXICANO'' CLAVE, FONDO SECTORIAL AMBIENTAL [SEMARNAT-CONACYT-2002-C01-00021]","WE APPRECIATE THE ASSISTANCE FROM A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS.

HOWEVER, PLEISTOCENE CLIMATE CHANGES AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS MIGHT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO PLANT GENETIC STRUCTURING ALONG THE VOLCANIC BELT. HERE, WE ANALYSED PHYLOGEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS OF THE PARROT-MISTLETOE PSITTACANTHUS CALYCULATUS TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS. LOCATION: TRANS-MEXICAN VOLCANIC BELT. METHODS: USING NUCLEAR AND CHLOROPLAST DNA SEQUENCE DATA FOR 370 INDIVIDUALS, WE INVESTIGATE THE GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION OF 35 POPULATIONS ACROSS THE SPECIES RANGE. WE CONDUCTED PHYLOGENETIC, POPULATION AND SPATIAL GENETIC ANALYSES OF P. CALYCULATUS SEQUENCES ALONG WITH ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELLING AND BAYESIAN INFERENCE METHODS TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE STRUCTURING OF GENETIC VARIATION OF THESE POPULATIONS. RESULTS: OUR ANALYSES REVEALED POPULATION STRUCTURE WITH THREE GENETIC GROUPS CORRESPONDING TO INDIVIDUALS FROM OAXACA AND THOSE FROM THE CENTRAL-EASTERN AND WESTERN TMVB REGIONS. A SIGNIFICANT GENETIC SIGNAL OF DEMOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, AN EAST-TO-WEST EXPANSION PREDICTED BY SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELLING, AND APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION ANALYSES STRONGLY SUPPORTED A SCENARIO OF HABITAT ISOLATION AND INVASION OF TMVB BY P. CALYCULATUS DURING THE LATE-PLEISTOCENE. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: THE GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION OF P. CALYCULATUS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF (1) GEOGRAPHICAL ISOLATION LINKED TO THE EFFECTS OF THE GLACIAL/INTERGLACIAL CYCLES AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, DRIVING GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION FROM CONGENERS INTO MORE XERIC VEGETATION AND (2) THE INVASION OF TMVB FROM EAST TO WEST, SUGGESTING A ROLE FOR BOTH COLONIZATION AND GLACIAL/INTERGLACIAL CYCLES MODELS.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"FRANCISCO.ORNELAS@INECOL.MX",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","FL2VH","10.1111/jbi.13070",NA,NA,"1365-2699",NA,NA,"CONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIACONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA (CONACYT) [61710, 155686, 365006/248109]; DEPARTAMENTO DE BIOLOGIA EVOLUTIVA, INSTITUTO DE ECOLOGIA, AC [20030/10563]","CONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: 61710, 155686, 365006/248109, 155686; DEPARTAMENTO DE BIOLOGIA EVOLUTIVA, INSTITUTO DE ECOLOGIA, AC, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: 20030/10563",NA,"0305-0270","J.

IN THIS STUDY, WE USE ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS TO INFER THE CURRENT AND FUTURE DISTRIBUTION OF NEW CALEDONIAN PARAKEETS (CYANORAMPHUS SAISSETI), HORNED PARAKEETS (EUNYMPHICUS CORNUTUS), AND OUVEA PARAKEETS (EUNYMPHICUS UVAEENSIS) IN NEW CALEDONIA. IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT A NEW METHOD OF ASSESSING THE POPULATION SIZE OF EACH SPECIES BASED ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL ABUNDANCE AND MODELLED HABITAT SUITABILITY. ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATES, THERE ARE 5708 (5048-6174) NEW CALEDONIAN PARAKEETS ON THE MAIN ISLAND OF NEW CALEDONIA, DISTRIBUTED OVER AN AREA OF 2783 KM(2), OF WHICH 1939 KM(2) IS FORESTED. WE ESTIMATE THERE TO BE 8690(7934-9445) HORNED PARAKEETS, AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION EXTENDS OVER 3482 KM(2), INCLUDING 2162 KM(2) OF FOREST. IN COMPARISON, THE OUVEA PARAKEET HAS A VERY RESTRICTED RANGE OF 34 KM(2) (MOST OF WHICH IS FORESTED), AND A POPULATION ESTIMATED AT 1730 (963-3203) INDIVIDUALS. PROJECTIONS INVOLVING SIMULATED CLIMATE CHANGE SUGGEST THAT POPULATIONS OF NEW CALEDONIAN PARAKEETS AND HORNED PARAKEETS MAY RECEDE INTO AREAS AT HIGHER ALTITUDES IN THE FUTURE, PRIMARILY ALONG THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN CHAIN OF THE MAINLAND. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT HOW THE OUVEA PARAKEET WILL RESPOND TO THE CLIMATIC CHANGES FORECAST FOR OUVEA, AS THE SPECIES IS EXPECTED TO FACE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS IN THE FUTURE THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THOSE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCED ON THE ISLAND. OUR RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CURRENT RESERVE SYSTEM IN NEW CALEDONIA IS UNLIKELY TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT PROTECTION FOR PARAKEETS.

CONSEQUENTLY, THE WORLD SURFACE PREDICTED AT RISK OF PARROT INVASIONS INCREASED WITH SUCCESSIVE BANS. OF CONCERN, A REDIRECTION OF TRADE TOWARD DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WAS OBSERVED.

WE EXAMINED HOW TIME SINCE FIRE CAN INFLUENCE FOOD RESOURCES FOR THE ENDANGERED CARNABY'S COCKATOO (CALYPTORHYNCHUS LATIROSTRIS) IN BANKSIA WOODLANDS OF SOUTHWESTERN AUSTRALIA. TREE DENSITY AND CONE PRODUCTIVITY OF DOMINANT PLANT SPECIES, BANKSIA ATTENUATA AND BANKSIA MENZIESII, WERE COMPARED ACROSS 44 SITES OF VARYING POST-FIRE AGED VEGETATION. THE NUMBER OF CARNABY'S COCKATOOS THAT COULD BE SUPPORTED IN BANKSIA WOODLANDS WAS ESTIMATED USING THE BIRD'S ENERGETIC REQUIREMENTS AND SEED ENERGY CONTENT. BANKSIA ATTENUATA PRODUCED MORE CONES AT SITES AGED 10-30 YEARS SINCE FIRE IN BOTH SURVEY YEARS, WHILE CONE PRODUCTIVITY FOR B. MENZIESII WAS HIGHEST IN VERY OLD SITES (>35 YEARS SINCE FIRE) IN ONE YEAR ONLY. HIGHER NUMBERS OF CARNABY'S COCKATOOS WERE PREDICTED TO BE SUPPORTED IN VEGETATION AGED BETWEEN 14-30 YEARS SINCE FIRE, PEAKING IN VEGETATION AGED 20-25 YEARS. THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION OF POST-FIRE AGED VEGETATION WITHIN THIS AREA (>60\% BURNT WITHIN THE LAST 7 YEARS) IS PREDICTED TO SUPPORT 2725 CARNABY'S COCKATOOS, REPRESENTING 25-35\% OF THE ESTIMATED BIRDS RELIANT ON THE AREA. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT FOOD RESOURCES ARE INFLUENCED BY TIME SINCE FIRE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, IF OPTIMISING FOOD RESOURCES WAS AN OBJECTIVE, MAY BE MANIPULATED BY ALTERING BURNING PATTERNS. WHILE HUMAN AND ASSET PROTECTION IS A PRIORITY FOR PRESCRIBED BURNING, MANAGEMENT OF LANDSCAPES FOR IMPROVED PERSISTENCE OF THREATENED SPECIES IS ALSO IMPORTANT AND COMPLEX TRADE-OFFS WILL HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED.

EXCLUDING VARIABLES EXHIBITING A NICHE SHIFT INCREASES THE ACCURACY OF PREDICTIONS OF INVASION RISK GENERATED BY NATIVE-RANGE BASED DISTRIBUTION MODELS, EVIDENCING THAT SELECTION OF VARIABLES IS A CRUCIAL STEP WHEN STUDYING NICHE CHANGES DURING BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS.","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,"DIEDERIK.STRUBBE@UANTWERPEN.BE",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","AD1RR","10.1007/s10530-013-0539-3",NA,NA,"1573-1464",NA,NA,"FWO-VLAANDERENFWO","D.S.

DURING THE ONGOING INVASION OF EUROPE, THE ALEXANDRINE PARAKEET CONSIDERABLY EXPANDED ITS NICHE INTO COLDER CLIMATES WITH RESPECT TO THOSE OCCUPIED IN THE NATIVE RANGE. OUR RESULTS OFFER SOME SUPPORT TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INTERSPECIFIC FACILITATION WITH PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED RING-NECKED PARAKEETS PSITTACULA KRAMERI MAY CONTRIBUTE TO NICHE EXPANSION AND INVASION SUCCESS OF CONGENERIC ALEXANDRINE PARAKEETS.

THESE RELATIONSHIPS, HOWEVER, ARE DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET BECAUSE OF CONFOUNDING FACTORS THAT MAY INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINE THE ABUNDANCE OF VERTEBRATES AND THEIR RESOURCES. MOREOVER, VERIFYING LINKS BETWEEN VERTEBRATE AND RESOURCE ABUNDANCE IS COMPLEX BECAUSE HUMAN PERCEPTION OF RESOURCE ABUNDANCE MAY DIFFER FROM THAT OF NONHUMAN VERTEBRATES AND BECAUSE MANIPULATING RESOURCE ABUNDANCE ON AN ECOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL SCALE IS DIFFICULT. WE STUDIED THE DEPENDENCY OF FRUGIVORES ON FRUIT ABUNDANCE IN EASTERN AMAZONIAN FLOODPLAIN FORESTS DOMINATED BY ONE SPECIES OF PALM TREE (EUTERPE OLERACEA) FROM WHICH PEOPLE HARVEST FRUIT. WE FIRST COMPARED SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL USE BY FRUGIVOROUS PARROTS OF FOUR SITES DOMINATED BY E. OLERACEA AND FOUR SITES WITH NO E. OLERACEA. PARROTS SPENT 48-92\% MORE TIME IN THE FORMER, WHERE THEIR ACTIVITY OVER THE FRUITING SEASON MIRRORED THE ABUNDANCE OF FRUITS. TO TEST WHETHER FRUIT ABUNDANCE WAS THE MECHANISM UNDERLYING THESE PATTERNS, WE REMOVED FRUIT AT TWO INTENSITIES IN REPLICATED 1.8-HA PLOTS, AND THEN MONITORED RESPONSES OF FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS AND MAMMALS. HIGH-INTENSITY REMOVAL (75\% OF RIPE FRUIT HARVESTED) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF FRUGIVOROUS BIRD INDIVIDUALS BY 29\% AND THE LENGTH OF FRUGIVOROUS BIRD VISITS BY 68\%, RELATIVE TO CONTROLS. IN CONTRAST, LOW-INTENSITY REMOVAL (41\% OF RIPE FRUIT REMOVED) HAD NO IMPACT ON THESE METRICS. FRUGIVORE SPECIES RICHNESS DID NOT DIFFER AMONG TREATMENTS AND CONTROLS, BUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE FRUGIVORE COMMUNITY WAS ALTERED BY HARVEST, WITH THE PRESENCE OF 11 SPECIES BEING LINKED TO FRUIT ABUNDANCE. NONFRUGIVOROUS BIRDS DID NOT RESPOND TO EITHER INTENSITY OF FRUIT HARVEST. THE NUMBER OF FRUIT-EATING MAMMAL SPECIES WAS 58\% LOWER IN BOTH THE LOW- AND HIGH-REMOVAL TREATMENTS, RELATIVE TO CONTROL PLOTS. THESE RESULTS VERIFY THAT FRUIT ABUNDANCE INFLUENCES THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF FRUGIVORE COMMUNITIES AND THE ABUNDANCE AND FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES. THEY ALSO DOCUMENT SHORT-TERM DEPENDENCY OF FRUIT-EATING MAMMALS ON FRUIT ABUNDANCE. HARVEST OF FRUIT FROM FOREST SYSTEMS, A COMMON PRACTICE IN TROPICAL FORESTS, THEREFORE CAN AFFECT POPULATIONS OF FRUIT-EATING ANIMALS.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"MOEGENBURAS@NZP.SI.EDU",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-26","743XR","10.1890/02-0063",NA,NA,"1939-9170",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0012-9658","ECOLOGY","ECOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,"OCT",NA,"95","10",NA,NA,NA,"2600-2612","WILEY","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",NA,NA,94,"DO FRUGIVORES RESPOND TO FRUIT HARVEST?

TWO OF THE LIGHTLY DISTURBED AND TWO OF THE MORE HEAVILY DISTURBED SITES WERE WITHIN `PROTECTION FOREST' WHEREAS THE REST WERE CLASSIFIED AS `PRODUCTION FOREST'.

USING FOUR COVARIATES (DISTURBANCE LEVEL, PROTECTION STATUS, NUMBER OF LARGE TREES, AND NUMBER OF FIGS), 99\% OF PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF RED-KNOBBED HORNBILLS AT THE POINTS COULD BE EXPLAINED BY HABITAT DISTURBANCE AND 87\% BY FOREST STATUS; THE SAME COVARIATES EXPLAINED 76\% OF PRESENCE/ABSENCE FOR THE SULAWESI TARICTIC HORNBILL WITH ABUNDANCE OF LARGE TREES AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOREST FRAGMENTATION AND THE GEOGRAPHIC POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PARROT SPECIES IN THE YUCATAN PENINSULA, MEXICO. THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE MEXICAN PORTION OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA BIOTIC REGION, WHICH INCLUDES THE STATES OF CAMPECHE, QUINTANA ROO AND YUCATAN. WE WORKED WITH THE EIGHT SPECIES OF PSITTACIDS THAT INHABIT THE SELECTED AREAS: EUPSITTULA NANA, AMAZONA ALBIFRONS, AMAZONA XANTHOLORA, AMAZONA AUTUMNALIS, PIONUS SENILIS, PYRILIA HAEMATOTIS, AMAZONA ORATRIX AND AMAZONA FARINOSA. FOR THESE SPECIES, WE USED THE POTENTIAL GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION MAPS THAT WERE OBTAINED THROUGH THE MAXIMUM ENTROPY ALGORITHM, PUBLISHED IN 2014. TO MEASURE THE LEVELS OF FOREST FRAGMENTATION IN THE PENINSULA, WE EMPLOYED THE LAND USE AND VEGETATION MAPS FROM SERIES IV (2007-2010) OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STATISTICS AND GEOGRAPHY. WE CALCULATED DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE METRICS AT 100 SITES RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED WITHIN THE PREDICTED PRESENCE AND ABSENCE AREAS FOR THE SPECIES. MULTIVARIATE METHODS WERE USED TO SHORTEN DIMENSIONALITY IN THE ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS TO EXPLORE THE OBSERVED PATTERNS. WE DID NOT FIND ANY PATTERN REGARDING THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS (LR) AND THE SIZE OF THE PARROTS' POTENTIAL GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION AREA WITHIN THE PENINSULA. FOR PYRILIA HAEMATOTIS AND AMAZONA ORATRIX, THE FRAGMENTATION VARIABLES USED DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR POTENTIAL GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE PENINSULA (INTERSECTION, PR<0.0001). ONLY FOR EUPSITTULA NANA, AMAZONA XANTHOLORA AND PIONUS SENILIS, WE FOUND THAT THE MEAN PATCH EDGE, THE MEAN SHAPE INDEX AND THE MEAN PERIMETERAREA RATIO WERE IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE THEIR POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS, RESPECTIVELY; AND, IN GENERAL, THE VARIABLES INDICATED THE PREFERENCES OF THESE PARROTS TO OCCUPY LARGER HABITAT PATCHES. PARROTS MUST BE GIVEN A SPECIAL CARE AND PROTECTION WITHIN THE STATES OF CAMPECHE AND QUINTANA ROO, SINCE THERE ARE AREAS WITH HIGH PARROT DIVERSITY AND ARE IMPORTANTLY AFFECTED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES. THE BEST RECOMMENDATION FOR MANAGERS AND USERS OF PROTECTED AREAS WITHIN THE YUCATAN PENINSULA IS THAT EXTENSIVE AREAS OF FOREST SHOULD BE MAINTAINED IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE SUVIVAL OF PSITTACID POPULATIONS.","UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",NA,"ALEXPLA79@GMAIL.COM GESCALON@ECOSUR.MX YFERRERSANCHEZ@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","FR3XK",NA,NA,NA,"2215-2075",NA,NA,"CONACYTCONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA (CONACYT) [239499, 21467]","WE ARE GRATEFUL TO D.

WE USED BIOCLIMATIC MODELLING TO PREDICT THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF INTRODUCED SUGAR GLIDERS ACROSS THE STUDY AREA AND ASSESSED THE PREDATION RISK TO SWIFT PARROTS AND OTHER THREATENED BIRDS IN THE REGION USING NEST-SURVIVAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS DAILY SURVIVAL OF NESTS IN AREAS WHERE SUGAR GLIDERS OCCURRED WAS MEAN 0.97, WHICH EQUATED TO A TRUE LIKELIHOOD OF 0.17 FOR A NEST TO SURVIVE THE 60-DAY NESTING PERIOD. NO NESTS FAILED ON AN OFFSHORE ISLAND WHERE SUGAR GLIDERS WERE SHOWN TO BE ABSENT. MOST CASES (83.3\%) OF GLIDER PREDATION RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF THE ADULT FEMALE PARROT. ON THE TASMANIAN MAINLAND, THERE WAS A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEST SURVIVAL AND INCREASING MATURE FOREST COVER AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE. MAIN CONCLUSIONS PREDATION RISK VARIED DRAMATICALLY ACROSS THE BREEDING RANGE OF SWIFT PARROTS, DEPENDING ON THE PRESENCE OF SUGAR GLIDERS. OFFSHORE ISLANDS ARE AN IMPORTANT REFUGE FOR SWIFT PARROTS BECAUSE SUGAR GLIDERS ARE ABSENT. HOWEVER, ISLANDS ARE VULNERABLE, AND OUR BIOCLIMATIC MODEL SHOWS THAT THEY ARE BIOCLIMATICALLY SUITABLE FOR SUGAR GLIDERS. SYNERGISTIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PREDATION AND HABITAT LOSS COMBINE WITH LOW BREEDING-SITE PHILOPATRY TO EXPOSE SWIFT PARROTS TO DRAMATIC VARIATION IN PREDATION RISK DEPENDING ON NESTING LOCATION.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"DEJAN.STOJANOVIC@ANU.EDU.AU",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","AR9BG","10.1111/ddi.12214",NA,NA,"1472-4642",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1366-9516","DIVERS.

THIS COULD BE THE CASE FOR SOME ANDEAN AND TRANS-ANDEAN POPULATIONS OF PYRRHURA PARAKEETS IN COLOMBIA THAT HAVE RESTRICTED AND ISOLATED GEOGRAPHIC RANGES, AND WHOSE CONSERVATION STATUS HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED BECAUSE NOMINAL SPECIES COVERING THEM ARE CONSIDERED OF ``LEAST CONCERN''. AS PART OF RESEARCH INTO THE BIOGEOGRAPHIC HISTORY AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS OF THE GENUS PYRRHURA, WE USED MAXENT MODELLING TO MAKE A FIRST APPROACH TO THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND CONSERVATION STATUS OF THESE POPULATIONS, AND TO DETERMINE IF THEY COULD BE CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT CONSERVATION UNITS. AS WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF PYRRHURA, WE FOUND THAT THEIR CLIMATIC NICHE WAS RESTRICTED TO HUMID REGIONS OF THE ANDES AND THE ANDEAN FOOTHILLS, RESULTING IN ISOLATED AND DISCONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPICAL HUMID FOREST ZONOBIOME. COMPARING OUR ESTIMATES OF AREA OF OCCUPANCY WITH THE ESTABLISHED THRESHOLDS FOR IUCN CRITERION B-2, THE FOUR SUBSPECIES STUDIED COULD BE CONSIDERED THREATENED. THE SMALL GEOGRAPHIC RANGES, APPARENT VULNERABILITY TO FOREST FRAGMENTATION COMPARED WITH OTHER PARROTS, AND EXTENSIVE HABITAT LOSS EXPERIENCED BY THE ANDEAN AND TRANS-ANDEAN SUBSPECIES OF P.

LINKED DEMOGRAPHIC-BIOCLIMATIC MODELS ARE EMERGING TOOLS FOR FORECASTING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON WELL-STUDIED SPECIES, BUT THESE METHODS HAVE BEEN USED IN FEW MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS, AND SPECIES INTERACTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN INCORPORATED. WE COMBINED POPULATION AND BIOCLIMATIC ENVELOPE MODELS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE RISKS TO THE VIABILITY OF A COCKATOO POPULATION POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE, INCREASED FIRE FREQUENCY, BEAK-AND-FEATHER DISEASE AND REDUCED MANAGEMENT. 2. THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN GLOSSY BLACK-COCKATOO CALYPTORHYNCHUS LATHAMI HALMATURINUS IS RESTRICTED TO KANGAROO ISLAND, AUSTRALIA, WHERE IT NUMBERS 350 BIRDS AND IS MANAGED INTENSIVELY. THE COCKATOO MAY BE AT PARTICULAR RISK FROM CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE OF ITS INSULAR GEOGRAPHIC CONSTRAINTS AND SPECIALISED DIET ON A SINGLE PLANT SPECIES, ALLOCASUARINA VERTICILLATA. THE COCKATOO POPULATION MODEL WAS PARAMETERISED WITH MARK-RESIGHT-DERIVED ESTIMATES OF SURVIVAL AND FECUNDITY FROM 13 YEARS OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. SPECIES INTERACTIONS WERE INCORPORATED BY USING A CLIMATE-CHANGE-DRIVEN BIOCLIMATIC MODEL OF ALLOCASUARINA VERTICILLATA AS A DYNAMIC DRIVER OF HABITAT SUITABILITY. A NOVEL APPLICATION OF LATIN HYPERCUBE SAMPLING WAS USED TO ASSESS THE MODELS SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS. 3. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT UNMITIGATED CLIMATE CHANGE IS LIKELY TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL THREAT FOR THE COCKATOO: ALL HIGH-CO2-CONCENTRATION SCENARIOS HAD EXPECTED MINIMUM ABUNDANCES OF <160 BIRDS. EXTINCTION WAS VIRTUALLY CERTAIN IF MANAGEMENT OF NEST-PREDATING BRUSH-TAIL POSSUMS TRICHOSURUS VULPECULA WAS STOPPED, OR ADULT SURVIVAL REDUCED BY AS LITTLE AS 5\%. IN CONTRAST, THE POPULATION IS PREDICTED TO INCREASE UNDER LOW-EMISSIONS SCENARIOS. 4. DISEASE OUTBREAK, INCREASED FIRE FREQUENCY AND REDUCTIONS IN REVEGETATION AND MANAGEMENT OF COMPETITIVE LITTLE CORELLAS CACATUA SANGUINEA, WERE ALL PREDICTED TO EXACERBATE DECLINE, BUT THESE EFFECTS WERE BUFFERED BY THE COCKATOO POPULATIONS HIGH FECUNDITY. 5. SPATIAL CORRELATES OF EXTINCTION RISK, SUCH AS RANGE AREA AND TOTAL HABITAT SUITABILITY, WERE NONLINEARLY RELATED TO PROJECTED POPULATION SIZE IN THE HIGH-CO2-CONCENTRATION SCENARIO. 6. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. MECHANISTIC DEMOGRAPHIC-BIOCLIMATIC SIMULATIONS THAT INCORPORATE SPECIES INTERACTIONS CAN PROVIDE MORE DETAILED VIABILITY ANALYSES THAN TRADITIONAL BIOCLIMATIC MODELS AND BE USED TO RANK THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF MANAGING POSSUM PREDATION AND MAINTAINING HIGH ADULT COCKATOO SURVIVAL.

THERE IS A LACK OF CONSERVED TROPICAL SEMI-DECIDUOUS FOREST, WHICH PROVIDES OPTIMAL HABITAT FOR REPRODUCTION OF THIS PARROT, WITHIN THE CURRENT RANGE OF THE SPECIES. ONLY THE SOUTH, ALONG THE COAST OF OAXACA, HAS EXTENSIVE AREAS OF THIS HABITAT. THERE ARE ONLY THREE, SMALL, PROTECTED AREAS WITHIN THE SPECIES' CURRENT RANGE. CONSERVATION STRATEGIES NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED TO RESTORE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE THREE MAIN AREAS OF THE CURRENT RANGE OF THE YELLOW-HEADED PARROT ON THE PACIFIC COAST OF MEXICO.","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",NA,"APEREZARTEAGA@MAC.COM",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","678AE","10.1017/S0030605310000980",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"COORDINACION DE INVESTIGACION CIENTIFICA IN UNIVERSIDAD MICHOACANA DE SAN NICOLAS DE HIDALGO [8.6]; COMISION NACIONAL PARA CIENCIAS Y TECNOLOGIA (CONACYT)CONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA (CONACYT) [135702-V, 2002-C01-00021]; FONDO SECTORIAL DE INVESTIGACION AMBIENTAL OF THE SECRETARIA DEL MEDIO AMBIENTE Y RECURSOS NATURALES (SEMARNAT)","WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE FIELD ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY A.

ASSESSING POPULATION SIZE CAN BE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR GREGARIOUS SPECIES, SUCH AS PARROTS-ONE OF THE MOST THREATENED BIRD FAMILIES-WHOSE ECOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR GENERATE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN MONITORING EFFORTS. TO IMPROVE ESTIMATES OF ABUNDANCE FOR THE ENDANGERED VINACEOUS-BREASTED PARROT (AMAZONA VINACEA), WE COMBINED EXTENSIVE ROOST COUNTS OVER THE GLOBAL RANGE OF THE SPECIES (ARGENTINA, PARAGUAY, BRAZIL) WITH AN INTENSIVE REGIONAL SURVEY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS FIVE SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT PARROT ABUNDANCE IN WESTERN SANTA CATARINA STATE (WSC), BRAZIL, IN 2016 AND 2017. WE ESTIMATED ABUNDANCE AT BOTH REGIONAL AND WHOLE-RANGE SCALES USING N-MIXTURE MODELS OF REPLICATED COUNT DATA, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION. THE REGIONAL-SCALE ESTIMATE WAS 1826 +/- 236 AND 1896 +/- 105 INDIVIDUALS FOR 2016 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY; GLOBAL ABUNDANCE WAS ESTIMATED AT 7789 +/- 655 AND 8483 +/- 693 INDIVIDUALS FOR THE SAME TWO YEARS. WE FOUND NO STATISTICAL EVIDENCE OF POPULATION CHANGE AT EITHER SCALE OF THE ANALYSIS. ALTHOUGH OUR ASSESSMENTS OF ABUNDANCE AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE ARE LARGER THAN THOSE CURRENTLY REPORTED BY THE IUCN, WE SUGGEST THE VINACEOUS-BREASTED PARROT SHOULD REMAIN IN THE `ENDANGERED' IUCN THREAT CATEGORY PENDING FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF POPULATION TRENDS. WE RECOMMEND THAT ROOST-MONITORING PROGRAMS FOR PARROTS CONSIDER AND ADDRESS SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY THROUGH ADEQUATE FIELD PROTOCOLS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES, TO BETTER INFORM ASSESSMENTS OF POPULATION SIZE, TRENDS, AND THREAT STATUS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","108672","GONCALO.FERRAZ@UFRGS.BR",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","MW1ZL","10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108672",NA,NA,"1873-2917",NA,NA,"RUFFORD FOUNDATION [18013-D, 19835-1]; FUNDACAO GRUPO BOTICARIO DE PROTECAO A NATUREZA; COLUMBUS ZOO AQUARIUM; CNPQNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (CNPQ) [PP 312606/2013-3]","THIS WORK WAS ONLY POSSIBLE DUE TO THE GENEROUS DEDICATION OF 112 OBSERVERS AND LOCAL COORDINATORS WHO COUNTED VBPS THROUGHOUT THEIR DISTRIBUTION IN 2016 AND 2017.

CITIZEN SCIENCE SURVEYS CAN REVEAL THE LONG-TERM PERSISTENCE OF POORLY KNOWN NOMADIC TROPICAL BIRDS OCCUPYING FRAGMENTED FOREST PATCHES. WE APPLIED DYNAMIC OCCUPANCY MODELS TO 13 YEARS (2002-2014) OF CITIZEN SCIENCE-DRIVEN PRESENCE/ABSENCE DATA ON CAPE PARROT (POICEPHALUS ROBUSTUS), A FOOD NOMADIC BIRD ENDEMIC TO SOUTH AFRICA. WE MODELED ITS UNDERLYING RANGE DYNAMICS AS A FUNCTION OF RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION, AND CHANGE IN CLIMATE AND LAND COVER THROUGH THE ESTIMATION OF COLONIZATION AND EXTINCTION PATTERNS. THE RANGE OCCUPANCY OF CAPE PARROT CHANGED LITTLE OVER TIME (W = 0.75-0.83) BECAUSE EXTINCTION WAS BALANCED BY RECOLONIZATION. YET, THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE REGIONAL VARIABILITY IN OCCUPANCY AND DETECTION PROBABILITY INCREASED OVER THE YEARS. COLONIZATIONS INCREASED WITH WARMER TEMPERATURE AND AREA OF ORCHARDS, THUS EXPLAINING THEIR RANGE SHIFTS SOUTHEASTWARDS IN RECENT YEARS. ALTHOUGH COLONIZATIONS WERE HIGHER IN THE PRESENCE OF NESTS AND YELLOWWOOD TREES (AFROCARPUS AND PODOCARPUS SPP.), THE EXTINCTIONS IN SMALL FOREST PATCHES (<= 227 HA) AND DURING LOW PRECIPITATION (<= 41 MM) ARE ATTRIBUTED TO RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS AND UNSUITABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. LOSS OF INDIGENOUS FOREST COVER AND ARTIFICIAL LAKE/WATER BODIES INCREASED EXTINCTION PROBABILITIES OF CAPE PARROT. THE LAND USE MATRIX (FRUIT FARMS, GARDENS, AND CULTIVATIONS) SURROUNDING FOREST PATCHES PROVIDES ALTERNATIVE FOOD SOURCES, THEREBY FACILITATING SPATIOTEMPORAL COLONIZATION AND EXTINCTION IN THE HUMAN-MODIFIED MATRIX. OUR MODELS SHOW THAT CAPE PARROTS ARE VULNERABLE TO EXTREME CLIMATIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DROUGHT WHICH IS PREDICTED TO INCREASE UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT OF OPTIMUM SIZED HIGH-QUALITY FOREST PATCHES IS ESSENTIAL FOR LONG-TERM SURVIVAL OF CAPE PARROT POPULATIONS.

THE AREA SHELTERS A HIGH DIVERSITY OF HABITATS, REPRESENTING THE MAIN FORMATIONS FOUND IN THIS SUB-REGION: GRASSLANDS, SAVANNAH, FORESTED SAVANNAH, RIPARIAN FORESTS, BAYS AND SALINES, AND NEGRO RIVER ITSELF. THIS HABITAT VARIABILITY DETERMINES THE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF THE BIRD COMMUNITY, BECAUSE MOST SPECIES ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO SPECIFIC HABITATS. FOR THIS, WE STUDIED THE ABUNDANCE OF BIRD SPECIES FROM 2001 TO 2004 IN A PANTANAL AREA OF FAZENDA RIO NEGRO, AQUIDAUANA, BRAZIL. THE ABUNDANCE WAS COMPARED AMONG THOSE FOUR CONSECUTIVE YEARS, SEASONS (DRY AND WET), TIME OF THE DAY (MORNING AND AFTERNOON), AND ALSO BETWEEN SEVEN DIFFERENT HABITATS, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE VARIATION IN DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS AND HABITATS USED BY BIRDS. FOR THIS, WE USED THE LINEAR TRANSECT METHOD IN EACH OF THE SEVEN HABITATS, AND RECORDED BIRD ABUNDANCES TO OBTAIN RICHNESS. THE RICHNESS REGISTERED IN THE MOSAIC OF HABITATS WAS OF 201 SPECIES FOR THE SAVANNAH, 87 IN FORESTED SAVANNAH, 116 IN THE RIPARIAN FOREST, 75 IN GRASSLANDS, 120 IN BAYS, 92 IN THE SALINES AND 64 IN THE NEGRO RIVER, ACCOUNTING FOR 348 SPECIES IN THE PANTANAL OF RIO NEGRO. OVERALL, 98 SPECIES OF MIGRATORY BIRDS WERE REGISTERED. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHTED SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES REGARDING THE TOTAL ABUNDANCE OF BIRDS IN NHECOLANDIA: PSITTACIDAE WAS THE MOST ABUNDANT FAMILY IN THE REGION, WITH PROMINENCE IN ALL ENVIRONMENTS. RECURVIROSTRIDAE, A MONOSPECIFIC FAMILY, SHOWED EXPRESSIVE ABUNDANCE DUE TO THE DOMINANCE OF HIMANTOPUS MEXICANUS IN THE SALINAS, FOLLOWED BY ARDEIDAE, ANATIDAE AND CRACIDAE. OTHER FAMILIES WITH HIGH ABUNDANCE WERE TYRANNIDAE, COLUMBIDAE, THRAUPIDAE AND EMBERIZIDAE, ALL IN PREDOMINANTLY TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS. MOREOVER: A) THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF SPECIMENS WAS RECORDED IN THE MORNING PERIOD AND IN THE DRY SEASON, REGARDLESS OF THE HABITAT; B) THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN ABUNDANCE IN THE SAME HABITAT ALONG THE YEARS, BUT THE ABUNDANCE WAS DIFFERENT AMONG HABITATS. IN GENERAL, THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THERE IS A RELATIVELY STABLE BIRD POPULATION IN EACH HABITAT ALONG THE ANNUAL CYCLE, BUT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN ABUNDANCE AMONG HABITATS. THUS, ADDITIONAL STUDIES ON FOOD AVAILABILITY IN DRY AND WET SEASONS SHOULD BE BETTER EXPLORED IN THE FUTURE, EITHER IN THIS REGION OR IN OTHER PANTANAL REGIONS. THIS FACT COULD BETTER EXPLAIN THE SEASONAL DYNAMICS OF THE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF BIRDS IN THE PANTANAL AREA IN GENERAL.","UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",NA,"RJDONAT@YAHOO.COM.BR DON.SADA@DRI.EDU GUISEMCAR@YAHOO.COM.BR VIANNA\_29@HOTMAIL.COM RAPHAEL.WHITACKER@IBB.UNESP.BR FEFE.2909@HOTMAIL.COM RAFAEL.MARTOS@YAHOO.COM.BR",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","FR3XK",NA,NA,NA,"2215-2075",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0034-7744","REV.

IN VIEW OF THIS, MANAGEMENT EFFORTS SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON INVASIVES THAT HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON NATIVE BIOTA. HOWEVER, ACTION AGAINST INVASIVES IS OFTEN HINDERED BY A LACK OF RELEVANT ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION SUCH AS THE EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION AND IMPACT OF THE INVADER. OUR AIMS WERE TO IDENTIFY THE HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS THAT INFLUENCE RING-NECKED PARAKEET ABUNDANCE IN BELGIUM AND TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF COMPETITION FOR NESTING CAVITIES WITH NATIVE HOLE-NESTERS. WE DETERMINED THE ABUNDANCE OF PARAKEETS AND NATIVE HOLE-NESTERS IN 44 STUDY SITES USING POINT COUNTS. WE EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARAKEET NUMBERS AND A SET OF HABITAT AND LANDSCAPE VARIABLES AND TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF COMPETITION, WE STUDIED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PARAKEETS AND THE NUMBER OF NATIVE HOLE-NESTERS. WE FOUND THAT PARAKEET ABUNDANCE DIFFERS BETWEEN VEGETATION TYPES BASED ON DOMINANT TREE SPECIES, AND THAT ABUNDANCE IS HIGHER IN FORESTS OR PARKS SURROUNDED BY BUILT-UP AREAS. PARAKEET NUMBERS WERE ALSO STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH CAVITY DENSITY, SUGGESTING THAT THIS MAY BE A LIMITING FACTOR. OF THE TWO NATIVE HOLE-NESTERS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST VULNERABLE TO COMPETITION (NUTHATCH AND STARLING), WE FOUND A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH PARAKEET NUMBERS FOR THE NUTHATCH ONLY. NO RELATIONS WERE FOUND WITH STARLINGS OR ANY OF THE OTHER HOLE-NESTING SPECIES EXAMINED.

THIS SPECIES IS VULNERABLE TO EXTINCTION AND HAS SHOWN STRIKING RANGE RETRACTIONS IN RECENT DECADES, WITHDRAWING BROADLY FROM SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF ITS HISTORICAL DISTRIBUTION. ITS RANGE REDUCTION HAS GENERALLY BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE EFFECTS OF HABITAT LOSS; HOWEVER, AS THIS SPECIES HAS ALSO DISAPPEARED FROM LARGE FORESTED AREAS, CONSIDERATION OF OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY ACT IN CONCERT IS MERITED. LOCATION HISTORICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE BLUE-WINGED MACAW IN BRAZIL, EASTERN PARAGUAY AND NORTHERN ARGENTINA. METHODS WE USED A CORRELATIVE APPROACH TO TEST A HYPOTHESIS OF CAUSATION OF OBSERVED SHIFTS BY REDUCTION OF HABITABLE AREAS MEDIATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. WE DEVELOPED MODELS OF THE ECOLOGICAL NICHE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BLUE-WINGED MACAW, BASED ON POINT-OCCURRENCE DATA AND CLIMATE SCENARIOS FOR PRE-1950 AND POST-1950 PERIODS, AND TESTED MODEL PREDICTIVITY FOR ANTICIPATING GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTIONS WITHIN TIME PERIODS. THEN WE PROJECTED EACH MODEL TO THE OTHER TIME PERIOD AND COMPARED DISTRIBUTIONS PREDICTED UNDER BOTH CLIMATE SCENARIOS TO ASSESS SHIFTS OF HABITABLE AREAS ACROSS DECADES AND TO EVALUATE AN EXPLANATION FOR OBSERVED RANGE RETRACTIONS. RESULTS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTED DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE BLUE-WINGED MACAW OVER THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WERE, IN GENERAL, MINOR AND NO CHANGE IN SUITABILITY OF LANDSCAPES WAS PREDICTED ACROSS LARGE AREAS OF THE SPECIES' ORIGINAL RANGE IN DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS. NO TENDENCY TOWARDS RANGE RETRACTION IN THE SOUTH WAS PREDICTED, RATHER CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE SPECIES' RANGE TENDED TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT FOR THE SPECIES. MAIN CONCLUSIONS OUR TEST PERMITTED ELIMINATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS A LIKELY EXPLANATION FOR THE OBSERVED SHIFTS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BLUE-WINGED MACAW, AND POINTS RATHER TO OTHER CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS (E.G.

POPULAR PET SPECIES, SUCH AS PARROTS AND PARAKEETS (AVES, PSITTACIFORMES), ARE OFTEN INTRODUCED OUTSIDE THEIR NATIVE RANGE AS A RESULT OF THE PET TRADE. ON ESCAPE FROM CAPTIVITY, SOME SUCH SPECIES, SUCH AS THE RING-NECKED PARAKEET AND THE MONK PARAKEET, ARE HIGHLY INVASIVE AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE WITH NATIVE SPECIES. POPULATIONS OF AMAZON PARROTS (AMAZONA SPP.) CAN BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, BUT DATA ON THEIR STATUS, DISTRIBUTION AND IMPACT ARE INCOMPLETE. WE GATHERED AND REVIEWED THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION CONCERNING GLOBAL TRADE, DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE AND ECOLOGY OF AMAZON PARROTS OUTSIDE THEIR NATIVE RANGE. OUR REVIEW SHOWS THAT AT LEAST NINE SPECIES OF AMAZON PARROTS HAVE ESTABLISHED POPULATIONS OUTSIDE THEIR ORIGINAL RANGE OF OCCURRENCE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD (IN EUROPE, SOUTH AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS, HAWAII, AND NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA). THEIR ELUSIVE BEHAVIOUR AND SMALL POPULATION SIZE SUGGEST THAT THE NUMBER OF ALIEN NUCLEI COULD BE UNDERESTIMATED OR AT UNDETECTED. DESPITE INTERNATIONAL TRADE BANS, THE LARGE TRADE OF WILD-CAUGHT AMAZON PARROTS IN PAST DECADES APPEARS TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ALIEN POPULATIONS WORLDWIDE. ESTABLISHMENT SUCCESS SEEMS TO DIFFER GEOGRAPHICALLY. WHILE EUROPEAN POPULATIONS ARE STILL SMALL AND GROWING SLOWLY, USA POPULATIONS ARE LARGE AND EXPANDING GEOGRAPHICALLY. THIS DIFFERENCE IS NOT RELATED TO LARGE PROPAGULE PRESSURE ( TRADE) BUT POSSIBLY TO A BETTER NICHE MATCH BETWEEN NATIVE AND INTRODUCED RANGES. AMAZONA AESTIVA IS THE MOST FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED AMAZONA PARROT, WITH AT LEAST EIGHT ALIEN POPULATIONS REPORTED TO DATE. ALL THESE POPULATIONS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE IN THE USA WHERE THE CLIMATE IS MORE SUITABLE FOR THEIR ESTABLISHMENT, ARE COMPOSED OF A LOW NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED AS LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON THE ECOLOGY AND POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THESE ALIEN POPULATIONS.","PASSEIG PICASSO S-N, PARC CIUTADELLA, BARCELONA, E-08003, SPAIN",NA,"MORIEMILIANO@TISCALI.IT",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","ER2BV","10.32800/abc.2017.40.0049",NA,NA,"2014-928X",NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COST ACTION ES1304 (PARROTNET); PORTUGUESE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE; EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND, THROUGH FCT, UNDER POPH - QREN - TYPOLOGY 4.1 [SFRH/BPD/93079/2013]","THE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL TO W.

THE PATTERNS OF DISTRIBUTION HAVE BEEN SHAPED BY HISTORICAL AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT PLAY DIFFERENT ROLES AT BOTH TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL SCALES. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH WERE TO CHARACTERIZE THE HABITAT OF THE ENDANGERED MILITARY MACAW (ARA MILITARIS) AND EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SPECIES BASED ON TRENDS OF LAND USE CHANGES IN MEXICO. WE CHARACTERIZED THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND FLORISTIC COMPOSITION OF 8 FORESTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY USED BY THE MILITARY MACAW FOR BREEDING AND FEEDING AND COMPARED THE RESULTS WITH 6 SIMILAR FORESTS CHARACTERIZED IN OTHER STUDIES BUT WITHOUT HISTORICAL RECORDS OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MILITARY MACAW. THE MILITARY MACAW PREFERRED SITES WITH HIGH DIVERSITY OF PLANT SPECIES DOMINATED BY TREES FROM 4 TO 15M IN HEIGHT AND FROM 5 TO 90CM IN DIAMETER AT BREAST HEIGHT. WE IDENTIFIED 236 PLANT SPECIES IN THE 8 FORESTS WITH 20 SPECIES (8.4\%) USED FOR NESTING AND FEEDING BY THE MILITARY MACAW. THE FLORISTIC COMPOSITION IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE MILITARY MACAW BECAUSE THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORESTS WITH AND WITHOUT ITS PRESENCE. THE POTENTIAL AREA OF DISTRIBUTION OF THE MILITARY MACAW HAD DECREASED BY 32\% AND THE REMNANT AREAS ARE INCLUDED IN ONLY 8 NATIONAL PROTECTED AREAS. THE PROTECTED AREAS OF NATURAL FORESTS SHOULD BE INCREASED TO PRESERVE THE SITES OF POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION AND CONSEQUENTLY THE HABITAT OF THE MILITARY MACAW IN MEXICO.

WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER GEOGRAPHIC VARIABLES SUCCESSFULLY PREDICTED PARAKEET INCURSIONS, AND USED SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON AGRICULTURAL ASSETS. WE RECORDED 864 INCURSIONS FOR THE PERIOD 1999-2013; MOSTLY ESCAPED BIRDS REPORTED TO MISSING ANIMAL WEBSITES. ESCAPES WERE REPORTED MOST FREQUENTLY WITHIN, OR AROUND, LARGE CITIES. INCURSIONS WERE BEST PREDICTED BY FACTORS RELATED TO HUMAN PRESENCE AND ACTIVITY, SUCH AS GLOBAL HUMAN FOOTPRINT AND INTENSIVE LAND USES. WE RECOMMEND SURVEILLANCE OF HIGH (PREDICTED) ESTABLISHMENT AREAS ADJACENT TO CITIES WHERE A FERAL PARAKEET POPULATION COULD MOST AFFECT HORTICULTURAL PRODUCTION. NOVEL PASSIVE SURVEILLANCE DATASETS COMBINED WITH SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY THE REGIONS WHERE POTENTIAL INVASIVE SPECIES ARE MOST LIKELY TO ESTABLISH.

WE AIMED TO DETERMINE THE SPECIES IDENTITY, NEST SITE REQUIREMENTS, RELATIVE NEST ABUNDANCE, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, AND INTERACTIONS OF PARROTS WITH NATIVE CAVITY-NESTING BIRD SPECIES. METHODS: WE SEARCHED MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, AND NEARBY AREAS FOR NATURAL CAVITIES AND HOLES EXCAVATED BY WOODPECKERS, RECORDING ATTRIBUTES OF POTENTIAL NEST TREES. WE INSPECTED ALL CAVITIES WITH AN ELEVATED VIDEO INSPECTION SYSTEM TO DETERMINE OCCUPANCY BY PARROTS OR OTHER BIRDS. WE MAPPED NEARLY 4000 CITIZEN SCIENCE OBSERVATIONS OF PARROTS IN OUR STUDY AREA CORRESPONDING TO OUR STUDY PERIOD, AND USED THESE TO CONSTRUCT RANGE MAPS, COMPARING THEM TO OUR NESTING OBSERVATIONS. RESULTS: NOT ALL PARROTS REPORTED OR OBSERVED IN OUR STUDY AREA WERE ACTIVELY BREEDING. SOME PARROTS WERE OBSERVED AT TREE CAVITIES, WHICH PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED IS EVIDENCE OF REPRODUCTION, BUT OUR INSPECTIONS WITH AN ELEVATED VIDEO INSPECTION SYSTEM SUGGEST THEY NEVER INITIATED NESTING ATTEMPTS. SEVERAL PARROT SPECIES DID SUCCESSFULLY NEST IN TREE CAVITIES, RED-MASKED PARAKEETS (PSITTACARA ERYTHROGENYS) AND ORANGE-WINGED PARROTS (AMAZONA AMAZONICA) BEING THE MOST COMMON (N = 7 AND 6 NESTS, RESPECTIVELY). THESE TWO PARROTS HAD SIMILAR NESTING REQUIREMENTS, BUT ORANGE-WINGED PARROTS USE NESTS WITH LARGER ENTRANCE HOLES, WHICH THEY OFTEN ENLARGE. GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF NESTS COMBINED WITH CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA INDICATE THAT PARROTS ARE LIMITED TO DEVELOPED AREAS. THE MOST COMMON PARROTS WERE LESS ABUNDANT CAVITY NESTERS THAN THE NATIVE BIRDS WHICH PERSIST IN MIAMI'S URBAN AREAS, AND FAR LESS ABUNDANT THAN THE INVASIVE EUROPEAN STARLING (STURNUS VULGARIS). CONCLUSIONS: EXOTIC PARROTS BREEDING ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE HARMED NATIVE CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS THROUGH INTERFERENCE COMPETITION, BUT COMPETITIVE INTERFERENCE IN SOUTHEAST FLORIDA IS MINIMIZED BY THE URBAN AFFINITIES OF PARROTS IN THIS REGION. THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION SUGGEST THAT THESE PARROTS ARE UNLIKELY TO INVADE ADJACENT WILDERNESS AREAS.","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","39","JDIAM009@FIU.EDU",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","KA2LA","10.1186/s40657-019-0176-3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY TROPICS PROGRAM; SUSAN S.

METHODSWE MODELLED THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF 11 SPECIES OF CERRADO PARROTS USING THE SOFTWARE MAXENT AT FOUR DIFFERENT SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS. WE BUILT MODELS USING ABIOTIC VARIABLES, BIOTIC VARIABLES (DISTRIBUTION OF DIET RESOURCES) AND MODELS COMBINING ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC VARIABLES. WE COMPARED MODEL PERFORMANCE USING THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE OF THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (AUC), RETRIEVED FROM TEST DATA. WE PARTITIONED THE VARIANCE BETWEEN SETS OF PREDICTORS USING A GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL (GLM). FINALLY, WE EVALUATED WHETHER IMPROVEMENT IN MODEL PERFORMANCE (HIGHER AUC VALUES) IN MODELS WITH BOTH ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC VARIABLES, WAS RELATED TO THE SPECIES' DIETARY NICHE BREADTH AND/OR SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THE MODELS. RESULTSWE FOUND THAT MODEL PERFORMANCE WAS IMPROVED IN MOST CASES BY THE ADDITION OF BIOTIC VARIABLES. OUR VARIANCE-PARTITIONING APPROACH REVEALED THAT ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC VARIABLES CONTRIBUTE INDEPENDENTLY TO THE FINAL MODEL. WE FOUND NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MODEL IMPROVEMENT AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION. WE ALSO FOUND NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIETARY NICHE BREADTH AND MODEL IMPROVEMENT, INDICATING THAT DIETARY GENERALIST AND SPECIALIST SPECIES WERE NOT DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED BY THE INCLUSION OF BIOTIC VARIABLES IN THE MODELS. MAIN CONCLUSIONSOUR RESULTS DID NOT SUPPORT THE ENH.

ENDEMIC SPECIES WITH SMALL RANGES ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO SUCH DECREASES IN RANGE SIZE, AS THE POPULATION SIZE MAY BE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY. TO ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF CLOUD FOREST SPECIES IN THE LONG TERM, IT IS CRUCIAL TO QUANTIFY POTENTIAL FUTURE SHIFTS IN THEIR DISTRIBUTION RANGES AND THE RELATED CHANGES IN HABITAT AVAILABILITY IN ORDER TO ASSURE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS OF CONSERVATION MEASURES. IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESSED THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE AVAILABILITY OF FORESTED HABITAT FOR THE ENDEMIC EL ORO PARAKEET. WE INVESTIGATED THE FUTURE RANGE SHIFT BY MODELLING THE CLIMATIC NICHE OF THE EL ORO PARAKEETS AND PROJECTING IT TO FOUR DIFFERENT CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS. DEPENDING ON THE INTENSITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THE EL ORO PARAKEETS SHIFT THEIR RANGE BETWEEN 500 AND 1700 M UPHILL BY THE YEAR 2100. ON AVERAGE, THE SHIFT IS ACCOMPANIED BY A REDUCTION IN RANGE SIZE TO 15\% AND A REDUCTION IN FORESTED HABITAT TO ONLY 10\% OF THE ORIGINAL EXTENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN POPULATIONS IN DIFFERENT AREAS IS DECREASING IN HIGHER ALTITUDES.

SECOND WE EVALUATE, WITH TRADITIONAL AND SPATIAL REGRESSION APPROACHES, THE GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS OF FRUGIVORE SPECIES RICHNESS AND PROPORTION.

MOST FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS (50\%) ARE FOUND WITHIN THE PERCHING BIRDS (PASSERIFORMES), BUT THE WOODPECKERS AND ALLIES (PICIFORMES), PARROTS (PSITTACIFORMES) AND PIGEONS (COLUMBIFORMES) ALSO CONTAIN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FRUGIVOROUS SPECIES (9-15\%). FRUGIVORE RICHNESS IS HIGHEST IN THE NEOTROPICS, BUT PEAKS IN OVERALL BIRD DIVERSITY IN THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS, THE EAST AFRICAN MOUNTAINS AND IN SOME AREAS OF BRAZIL AND BOLIVIA ARE NOT REFLECTED BY FRUGIVORES. CURRENT CLIMATE EXPLAINS MORE VARIANCE IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND PROPORTION OF FRUGIVORES THAN OF NON-FRUGIVORES WHEREAS IT IS THE OPPOSITE FOR HABITAT HETEROGENEITY.

WE PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND HISTORICAL CONSTRAINTS INFLUENCE GLOBAL PATTERNS OF AVIAN FRUGIVORY. WHEREAS WATER-ENERGY DYNAMICS POSSIBLY CONSTRAIN FRUGIVORE DISTRIBUTION VIA INDIRECT EFFECTS ON FOOD PLANTS, REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN AVIAN FRUGIVORY MOST LIKELY REFLECT HISTORICAL CONTINGENCIES RELATED TO THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF FLESHY FRUITED PLANT TAXA, NICHE CONSERVATISM AND PAST CLIMATE CHANGE.

STUDIES OF VARIATION IN LEARNED VOCALISATIONS ARE A PROMISING COMPLEMENTARY TOOL TO TRADITIONAL LANDSCAPE GENETICS STUDIES FOR IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL DISPERSAL BARRIERS. HERE WE USE MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES TO INFORM THE CONSERVATION OF A PARROT SPECIES. OBJECTIVES WE TESTED FOR CORRELATIONS BETWEEN LANDSCAPE RESISTANCE MODELS, POPULATION GENETIC STRUCTURE AND VOCAL VARIATION OF PARROTS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL BARRIERS ON GENETIC AND BEHAVIOURAL POPULATION STRUCTURE INCLUDING NARROW HABITAT CORRIDORS AND A MOUNTAIN RANGE. METHODS WE STUDIED PALM COCKATOOS (PROBOSCIGER ATERRIMUS) WITHIN THEIR AUSTRALIAN DISTRIBUTION. WE CONSTRUCTED LANDSCAPE RESISTANCE SURFACES RESTRICTED TO AREAS OF HIGH CLIMATIC SUITABILITY FROM A MAXIMUM ENTROPY (MAXENT) DISTRIBUTION MODEL. WE VERIFIED THREE LANDSCAPE RESISTANCE PREDICTIONS FROM CIRCUITSCAPE (ISOLATION BY ELEVATION, HABITAT AND DISTANCE) USING FOUR DATA SETS (INDIVIDUAL GENETIC DIVERGENCE, ACOUSTIC DIVERGENCE IN REPERTOIRE AND TWO CALL TYPES). RESULTS LANDSCAPE RESISTANCE MODELS REVEALED STRONG EFFECTS OF ISOLATION BY ELEVATION ON GENETIC, REPERTOIRE AND STRUCTURAL CALL DIFFERENTIATION. NEITHER ISOLATION BY HABITAT NOR ISOLATION BY DISTANCE WERE WELL SUPPORTED BY DIFFERENTIATION IN THE DATA. CONCLUSIONS OUR LANDSCAPE RESISTANCE ANALYSIS VALIDATED BY FOUR DATASETS SUPPORTS THE GREAT DIVIDING RANGE AS THE MAIN LIMITATION ON DISPERSAL AND CONNECTIVITY AMONG PALM COCKATOO POPULATIONS. COMBINED GENETIC AND BEHAVIOURAL APPROACHES CAN DETERMINE LANDSCAPE-LEVEL CONNECTIVITY OF INDIVIDUALS AND DEMONSTRATE HOW DISPERSAL BARRIERS INFLUENCE GENETIC AND BEHAVIOURAL PATTERNS IN A LARGE PARROT.","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,"MILES.KEIGHLEY@ANU.EDU.AU",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","KK5JP","10.1007/s10980-019-00938-0","DEC 2019",NA,"1572-9761",NA,NA,"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM SCHOLARSHIPAUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTDEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND SCIENCE; HERMON SLADE FOUNDATION; NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETYNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY; BIRDLIFE AUSTRALIA","THIS RESEARCH IS SUPPORTED BY AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM SCHOLARSHIP.

INFORMATION CONCERNING THEIR NESTING REQUIREMENTS IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DESIGN SPECIFIC RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION ACTIONS. TO ASSESS THIS, WE STUDIED THEIR NESTING ECOLOGY IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC, MICHOACAN, MEXICO DURING A TEN YEAR PERIOD. THE ANALYZED VARIABLES RANGED FROM LOCAL SCALE NEST SITE CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS NESTING TREE SPECIES, DIMENSIONS, GEOGRAPHIC POSITIONS, DIET AND NESTING FOREST PATCHES STRUCTURE, TO LARGE SCALE FEATURES SUCH AS VEGETATION USE AND CLIMATIC VARIABLES ASSOCIATED TO THE NESTING TREE DISTRIBUTIONS BY AN ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODEL USING MAXENT. WE ALSO EVALUATED THE PARROT TOLERANCE TO LAND MANAGEMENT REGIMES, AND COMPARED THE PACIFIC NEST TREES WITH 18 NEST TREES RECORDED IN AN INTENSIVELY MANAGED PRIVATE RANCH IN TAMAULIPAS, GULF OF MEXICO. PARROTS NESTED IN TALL TREES WITH CANOPY LEVEL CAVITIES IN 92 NEST-TREES RECORDED FROM 11 TREE SPECIES. THE 72.8\% OF NESTING OCCURRED IN TREES OF ASTRONIUM GRAVEOLENS, AND ENTEROLOBIUM CYCLOCARPUM WHICH QUALIFIED AS KEYSTONE TREES. THE FORESTS WHERE THE PARROTS NESTED, PRESENTED A MAXIMUM OF 54 TREE SPECIES, 50\% OF WHICH WERE IDENTIFIED AS FOOD SOURCE; BESIDES, THESE AREAS ALSO HAD A HIGH ABUNDANCE OF TREES USED AS FOOD SUPPLY. THE LOWEST NUMBER OF TREE SPECIES AND TREES TO FORAGE OCCURRED IN AN ACTIVE CATTLE RANCH, WHEREAS THE HIGHEST SPECIES RICHNESS WAS OBSERVED IN AREAS WITH NATURAL RECOVERY. THE NESTING CAVITY ENTRANCE HEIGHT FROM ABOVE GROUND OF THE PACIFIC NESTING TREES RESULTED HIGHER THAN THOSE FOUND IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE DIFFERENCES MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO PARROT BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES ADAPTING TO DIFFERENTIAL POACHING PRESSURE AND CAVITY AVAILABILITY. NESTING TREES WERE FOUND IN SIX VEGETATION TYPES; HOWEVER THE PARROTS PREFERRED CONSERVED AND RIPARIAN SEMI-DECIDUOUS FOREST FOR NESTING, WITH FEWER NESTS IN DECIDUOUS FOREST, WHILE NESTING IN TRANSFORMED AGRICULTURAL FIELDS WAS AVOIDED. THE MAIN CLIMATIC VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF NESTS WERE: MEAN TEMPERATURE OF WETTEST QUARTER, MEAN DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RANGE, AND PRECIPITATION OF WETTEST MONTH. SUITABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS FOR THE POTENTIAL PRESENCE OF NESTING TREES WERE PRESENT IN 61\% OF THE REGION; HOWEVER, MOST OF THE AREA CONSISTED OF TROPICAL DECIDUOUS FORESTS (55.8\%), WHILE SEMI-DECIDUOUS TROPICAL FORESTS COVERED ONLY 17\% OF THE REGION. THESE RESULTS INDICATED THE IMPORTANCE TO CONSERVE SEMI-DECIDUOUS FORESTS AS BREEDING HABITATS FOR THE YELLOW-HEADED PARROT, AND REVEALED THE URGENT NEED TO IMPLEMENT CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION ACTIONS. THESE SHOULD INCLUDE A TOTAL BAN OF LAND USE CHANGE IN TROPICAL SEMI-DECIDUOUS FOREST AREAS, AND FOR SELECTIVE LOGGING OF ALL KEYSTONE TREE SPECIES; BESIDES, WE RECOMMEND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES IN IMPORTANT NESTING AREAS, AND A SERIES OF TROPICAL FOREST RESTORATION PROGRAMS IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC COAST.","UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",NA,"TMONTER2002@YAHOO.COM.MX ALVAREZ\_JARA\_M@HOTMAIL.COM LORPA19@YAHOO.COM CARLOSTENA56@HOTMAIL.COM",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","AQ9PG","10.15517/rbt.v62i3.12269",NA,NA,"2215-2075",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0034-7744","REV.

THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF BIOCLIM ANALYSIS, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE SUPERB PARROT ARE DISCUSSED. A BIOCLIMATIC PROFILE BASED ON 115 OBSERVATIONS OF THE SPECIES WAS PRODUCED. SEVEN KEY PARAMETERS WERE CHOSEN FROM THE BIOCLIMATIC PROFILE, AND THEN MATCHED WITH OTHER LOCATIONS WITH SIMILAR CLIMATIC CONDITIONS TO PREDICT THE POTENTIAL GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. BIOCLIMATIC ANALYSIS INDICATED GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE LOCATION OF SUPERB PARROT OBSERVATIONS AND THE PREDICTED `CORE' AREA. OWING TO HABITAT LOSS AND MODIFICATION, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE SUPERB PARROT OCCUPIES A RELATIVELY SMALL PART OF ITS FORMER GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE. HENCE, SOME AREAS THAT ARE BIOCLIMATICALLY OPTIMAL MAY NO LONGER SUPPORT RESOURCES NEEDED BY THE SUPERB PARROT. BIOCLIM HAS SEVERAL LIMITATIONS, NOT LEAST OF WHICH IS THAT CLIMATIC TOLERANCES ARE ONLY ONE OF MANY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE `EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE' OF SPECIES. ALTHOUGH BIOCLIM HAS SOME PROBLEMS WHEN USED TO STUDY HIGHLY MOBILE BIRDS LIKE THE SUPERB PARROT, THE APPROACH PROVIDES A USEFUL STARTING POINT FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS, AND HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN DEFINING POTENTIAL GEOGRAPHICAL RANGES.","LEVEL 2, 11 QUEENS RD, MELBOURNE, VIC 3004, AUSTRALIA",NA,"ADRIANM@CRES.ANU.EDU.AU",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-26","973CQ","10.1071/MU04057",NA,NA,"1448-5540",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0158-4197","EMU","EMU-AUSTRAL ORNITHOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,NA,"31","3",NA,"MANNING, ADRIAN/0000-0003-0989-9203 LINDENMAYER, DAVID B/0000-0002-4766-4088 ",NA,"193-201","TAYLOR \& FRANCIS AUSTRALASIA","ZOOLOGY","MANNING, ADRIAN/AAG-2949-2019 LINDENMAYER, DAVID B/P-7183-2017 BARRY, SIMON/E-4612-2010",NA,4,"A BIOCLIMATIC ANALYSIS FOR THE HIGHLY MOBILE SUPERB PARROT OF SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA","ARTICLE","ISI000232500900001","0","8","105","ORNITHOLOGY",2005,"MANNING, AD (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), AUSTRALIAN NATL UNIV, CTR RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM STUDIES, CANBERRA, ACT 0200, AUSTRALIA","ISI","BEAUMONT LJ, 2002, GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL, V8, P954, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2486.2002.00490.X; BENNETT AF, 1999, LINKAGES LANDSCAPE R; BRERETON R, 1995, BIOL CONSERV, V72, P339, DOI 10.1016/0006-3207(94)00016-J; BUSBY JR, 1986, AUST J ECOL, V11, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1442-9993.1986.TB00912.X; BUSBY JR, 1991, BIOCLIM BIOCLIMATIC, P64; CLARIDGE AW, 2002, WILDLIFE RES, V29, P193, DOI 10.1071/WR01035; FISCHER J, 2001, J BIOGEOGR, V28, P293, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2699.2001.00554.X; FORSHAW JM, 2002, AUSTR PARROTS; GARNETT ST, 2000, ACTION PLAN AUSTR; HIGGINS PJ, 1999, HDB AUSTR NEW ZEALAN, V4; HOULDER D, 1999, ANUCLIM VERSION 5 0; *IUCN, 2002, 2002 IUCN RED LIST T; LINDENMAYER DB, 1991, J BIOGEOGR, V18, P371, DOI 10.2307/2845479; LINDENMAYER DB, 2002, CONSERVING FOREST BI; MANNING AD, 2003, THESIS AUSTR NATL U; NIX H.

THE PUERTO RICAN PARROT IS UNIQUE IN THAT, SINCE 2001, ALL KNOWN NESTING IN THE WILD HAS OCCURRED IN ARTIFICIAL CAVITIES, WHICH ALSO PROVIDED US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE NEST SITE SELECTION WITHOUT CONFOUNDING EFFECTS OF THE ACTUAL NEST CAVITY CHARACTERISTICS. BECAUSE OF THE DATA LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE SMALL POPULATION SIZE OF THIS CRITICALLY ENDANGERED ENDEMIC SPECIES, WE EMPLOYED A DISTRIBUTION-FREE STATISTICAL SIMULATION APPROACH TO ASSESS SITE SELECTION RELATIVE TO CHARACTERISTICS OF USED AND UNUSED NESTING SITES. NEST SITES SELECTED BY PUERTO RICAN PARROTS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY GREATER HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL VISIBILITY FROM THE NEST ENTRANCE, GREATER DENSITY OF MATURE SIERRA PALMS, AND A MORE WESTERLY AND LEEWARD ORIENTATION OF NEST ENTRANCES THAN UNUSED SITES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT NEST SITE SELECTION IN THIS SPECIES IS AN ADAPTIVE RESPONSE TO PREDATION PRESSURE, TO WHICH THE PARROTS RESPOND BY SELECTING NEST SITES OFFERING ADVANTAGES IN PREDATOR DETECTION AND AVOIDANCE AT ALL STAGES OF THE NESTING CYCLE. WE CONCLUDE THAT IDENTIFYING AND REPLICATING THE ``NEST GESTALT'' OF SUCCESSFUL NESTING SITES MAY FACILITATE CONSERVATION EFFORTS FOR THIS AND OTHER ENDANGERED AVIAN SPECIES.","ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-26","V21GE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICEUS FISH \& WILDLIFE SERVICE; U.S.D.A.

IN THIS STUDY, WE DETERMINED THE INFLUENCE OF FRAGMENTATION IN RELATION TO VEGETATION COVER, LAND USE, AND SPATIAL CONFIGURATION OF FRAGMENTS ON THE POTENTIAL GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF PARROTS IN THE YUCATAN PENINSULA, MEXICO. WE USED THE POTENTIAL GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION FOR EIGHT PARROT SPECIES, CONSIDERING THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED MAPS OBTAINED WITH THE MAXIMUM ENTROPY ALGORITHM, AND WE INCORPORATED THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FOR EACH SPECIES. WE CALCULATED 71 METRICS/VARIABLES THAT EVALUATE FOREST FRAGMENTATION, SPATIAL CONFIGURATION OF FRAGMENTS, THE RATIO OCCUPIED BY VEGETATION, AND THE LAND USE IN 100 PLOTS OF APPROXIMATELY 29 KM(2), RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED WITHIN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE AREAS PREDICTED FOR EACH SPECIES. WE ALSO CONSIDERED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES AND THE DISTRIBUTION PROBABILITY OF SPECIES. WE USED A PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION TO EXPLORE PATTERNS BETWEEN THE VARIABLES USED AND THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION MODELS. NONE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES ANALYZED ALONE DETERMINED THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE OR THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF PARROTS IN THE PENINSULA. WE FOUND THAT FOR THE EIGHT SPECIES, EITHER DUE TO THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE OR THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION, THE MOST IMPORTANT EXPLANATORY VARIABLES WERE THE INTERACTION AMONG THREE VARIABLES, PARTICULARLY THE INTERACTIONS AMONG THE TOTAL FOREST AREA, THE TOTAL EDGE, AND THE TROPICAL SEMI EVERGREEN MEDIUM HEIGHT FOREST. HABITAT FRAGMENTATION INFLUENCED THE POTENTIAL GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THESE SPECIES IN TERMS OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT ARE EXPRESSED TOGETHER WITH THE GEOGRAPHICAL DIVISION, SUCH AS THE DIFFERENT VEGETATION COVER RATIO AND LAND USES IN DEFORESTED AREAS.","PASSEIG PICASSO S-N, PARC CIUTADELLA, BARCELONA, E-08003, SPAIN",NA,"ALEXPLA79@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","CB3DW",NA,NA,NA,"2014-928X",NA,NA,"CONACYT (NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY) [239499, 21467]","WE ARE GRATEFUL TO CONACYT (NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY) FOR THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED THROUGH GRANTS 239499 AND 21467 AND TO INEGI (NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR GEOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS, MEXICO) FOR PROVIDING THE LAND USE AND VEGETATION MAP.

HOWEVER, A COMMON CONCERN IN MANY STUDIES EXAMINING SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS IS THAT ABSENCES CANNOT BE INFERRED WITH CERTAINTY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE WHERE THE SPECIES IS RARE, DIFFICULT TO DETECT AND/OR DOES NOT OCCUPY ALL AVAILABLE HABITAT CONSIDERED SUITABLE. THE WESTERN GROUND PARROT (PEZOPORUS WALLICUS FLAVIVENTRIS) OF SOUTHERN WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA, IS A CASE IN POINT, AS NOT ONLY IS IT RARE AND DIFFICULT TO DETECT, BUT IT IS ALSO UNLIKELY TO OCCUPY ALL AVAILABLE SUITABLE HABITAT. A RECENT SURVEY OF GROUND PARROTS PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE DISTRIBUTION MODEL. AS THE DATA WERE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FALSE ABSENCES, THESE WERE REPLACED WITH RANDOMLY SELECTED ` PSEUDO' ABSENCES AND MODELLED USING GLM. AS A COMPARISON, PRESENCE-ONLY INFORMATION WAS MODELLED USING A RELATIVELY NEW APPROACH, MAXENT, A MACHINE-LEARNING TECHNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PERFORM COMPARATIVELY WELL. THE PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE OF BOTH MODELS, AS ASSESSED BY THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC PLOT (ROC) WAS HIGH (AUC > 0.8), WITH MAXENT PERFORMING ONLY MARGINALLY BETTER THAN THE GLM. THESE APPROACHES BOTH INDICATED THAT THE GROUND PARROT PREFERS AREAS RELATIVELY HIGH IN ALTITUDE, DISTANT FROM RIVERS, GENTLY SLOPING TO LEVEL HABITAT, WITH AN INTERMEDIATE COVER OF VEGETATION AND WHERE THERE IS A MOSAIC OF VEGETATION AGES. IN THIS CASE, THE USE OF PRESENCE-ONLY INFORMATION RESULTED IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES DEFINING THE OCCURRENCE OF THE GROUND PARROT, BUT ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE INABILITY OF THE BIRD TO OCCUPY ALL SUITABLE HABITAT SHOULD BE A COMPONENT OF MODEL REFINEMENT.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"LESLEYG@DEC.WA.GOV.AU",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-26","222LB","10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00365.x",NA,NA,"1472-4642",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1366-9516","DIVERS.

OUR OBJECTIVES WERE: 1) TO DETERMINE HOW SLENDER-BILLED PARAKEETS (ENICOGNATHUS LEPTORHYNCHUS) USED A FRAGMENTED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE OF SOUTHERN CHILE IN TERMS OF LANDSCAPE COVER AND SCATTERED TREE ELEMENTS, 2) TO EXAMINE SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AND 3) TO PROVIDE CONSERVATION RECOMMENDATIONS TO LANDOWNERS AND MANAGERS INTERESTED IN CONSERVING THE SPECIES AND THE HABITATS IT USES. WE ESTIMATED PARAKEET ABUNDANCES AND LANDSCAPE COMPONENTS BY SAMPLING 30 36-KM(2) SITES ACROSS A 50 BY 80 KM REGION, CENTERED AT OSORNO. LANDSCAPE COMPONENTS WERE USED IN A MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION TO DETECT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THESE ELEMENTS AND SLENDER-BILLED PARAKEET ABUNDANCES. THE RESULTS OBTAINED REVEALED THE ABILITY OF THE VULNERABLE SLENDER-BILLED PARAKEET TO UTILIZE A MOSAIC LANDSCAPE. PARAKEETS USED THE LANDSCAPE DIFFERENTLY ACCORDING TO SEASONS. ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PARAKEET ABUNDANCES AND LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS DURING THE NON-BREEDING SEASON WERE NOT DETECTED. HOWEVER, LARGE NUMBERS OF SCATTERED TREES APPEARED TO BE IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT LARGER PARAKEET ABUNDANCES DURING THE BREEDING SEASON. MATURE TREES, AVAILABLE IN THE LANDSCAPE ONLY AS SCATTERED TREES, BENEFIT SLENDER-BILLED PARAKEETS AS NESTING AND FEEDING PLACES - THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF THEIR PRESENCE. SCATTERED TREES CAN ALSO BENEFIT THE SPECIES BY FACILITATING MOVEMENT ACROSS AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. THE PERSISTENCE OF THE SLENDER-BILLED PARAKEET IN THIS LANDSCAPE IS INTRINSICALLY LINKED TO THE CONSERVATION AND PERPETUATION OF ANY REMAINING PORTION OF ORIGINAL OLD-GROWTH FOREST, ESPECIALLY THE SCATTERED MATURE TREES. MANY ALTERNATIVES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS STUDY MAY HAVE APPLICABILITY TO SIMILAR LANDSCAPES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

THEY ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE IN ESTIMATING POPULATION TRENDS AND MANAGEMENT IMPACTS, AND THUS INFORMING EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION DECISIONS FOR DECLINING SPECIES. THE QUALITY AND POTENTIAL BIASES OF CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA ARE OF CONCERN, HOWEVER, AND APPROPRIATE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE MAXIMUM SCIENTIFIC VALUE IS EXTRACTED. WE INVESTIGATED THESE ISSUES IN A CITIZEN SCIENCE SURVEY OF THE ENDANGERED CARNABY'S BLACK-COCKATOO CALYPTORHYNCHUS LATIROSTRIS. SINCE 2010, CITIZEN SCIENTISTS HAVE CONDUCTED SYNCHRONIZED ANNUAL COUNTS OF CARNABY'S BLACK-COCKATOO AT ROOST SITES TO ESTIMATE THE POPULATION TREND. SURVEY EFFORT WAS SUBSTANTIAL, WITH C. 150 SITES SURVEYED BY > 260 VOLUNTEERS EACH YEAR. RELATIVELY FEW SITES WERE OCCUPIED, HOWEVER, AND ONLY 42 (16\%) OF THE 265 SITES SURVEYED IN TOTAL ACCOUNTED FOR 95\% OF ALL OBSERVATIONS. MANY SITES WERE EMPTY AND SURVEY EFFORT WAS OFTEN INCONSISTENT. TAKING THESE ISSUES INTO ACCOUNT, ANALYSIS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN ROOST OCCUPANCY RATE AND A NON-SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE MEAN SIZE OF ROOSTING FLOCKS, WITH AN ESTIMATED OVERALL TREND OF 14\% DECLINE PER ANNUM IN THE NUMBER OF ROOSTING BIRDS.

THESE IMPACTS OFTEN DIFFER DEPENDING ON SPECIES-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS. RANGE DATA ON FOREST DEPENDENT BIRD SPECIES FROM THE SOUTH AFRICAN BIRD ATLAS PROJECT (SABAP1 AND SABAP2) WERE ANALYSED TO DETERMINE LINKS BETWEEN DEFORESTATION, SPECIES CHARACTERISTICS AND RANGE DECLINES. HALF OF THE SPECIES STUDIED WERE FOUND TO HAVE DECLINING RANGES. RANGE CHANGE DATA FOR THESE SPECIES WERE CORRELATED WITH DATA ON CHANGES IN LAND COVER FROM 1990 TO 2014. TO DETERMINE WHICH LAND COVER CHANGES AFFECT EXTINCTION, OCCUPANCY WAS MODELLED FOR 30 SITES ACROSS SOUTH AFRICA WHICH EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF MORE THAN 10 SPECIES. MOST SPECIES LOST WERE BIRDS OF PREY OR INSECTIVORES. INDIGENOUS FOREST DECREASED IN 17\% (N = 5) SITES, WHILE PLANTATIONS/WOODLOTS DECREASED IN 60\% (N = 18) SITES. OCCUPANCY MODELLING SHOWED EXTINCTION TO BE MITIGATED BY PLANTATIONS IN 6/28 SPECIES, AND FOREST EXPANSION MITIGATED EXTINCTION IN 7/28 SPECIES. RESPONSES TO DEFORESTATION DID NOT APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO PARTICULAR SPECIES CHARACTERISTICS. HALF OF SOUTH AFRICA'S FOREST-DEPENDENT BIRD SPECIES HAVE DECLINING RANGES, WITH THE LOSS OF THESE SPECIES MOST PROMINENT IN THE EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE. FOUR RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN FOREST AND PLANTATION COVER ARE DISCUSSED: DIRECT EFFECTS, WITH FOREST LOSS CAUSING SPECIES LOSS; MATRIX EFFECTS, WHERE PLANTATION LOSS RESULTED IN SPECIES LOSS; DEGRADATION OF INDIGENOUS FOREST; AND THE ADVENT OF NEW FOREST ARISING FROM WOODY THICKENING CAUSED BY CARBON FERTILISATION, WHICH MAY NOT RESULT IN OPTIMAL HABITAT FOR FOREST-DEPENDENT BIRDS.","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",NA,"MIC@SUN.AC.ZA",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","FE8IV","10.1017/S095927091600040X",NA,NA,"1474-0001",NA,NA,"NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION (NRF); STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY","THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OF THE NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION (NRF) TOWARDS THIS RESEARCH IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED.

IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPLORED HABITAT FEATURES INFLUENCING ABUNDANCE AND DAMAGE OF MONK PARAKEETS (MYIOPSITTA MONACHUS) TO CORN (ZEA MAYS) AND SUNFLOWER (HELIANTHUS ANNUUS) FIELDS, AS A BASIS FOR THE DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTING DAMAGE IN THE FUTURE. USING A MULTI-LEVEL APPROACH, WE EVALUATED WITHIN-FIELD, FIELD, AND LANDSCAPE VARIABLES AT THREE SPATIAL SCALES POTENTIALLY RELATED TO MONK PARAKEET ABUNDANCE AND DAMAGE IN CROP FIELDS. MONK PARAKEET ABUNDANCE AND DAMAGE WAS GREATER IN SUNFLOWER THAN IN CORN FIELDS. LANDSCAPE VARIABLES, SUCH AS DISTANCE TO NEAREST SITE WITH TREES, PERCENTAGE OF LANDSCAPE WITH TREES, AND AVAILABILITY OF FORAGING SITES FOR MONK PARAKEETS AROUND THE CROP FIELDS WERE MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOCAL VARIABLES IN EXPLAINING MONK PARAKEET DAMAGE TO CROP FIELDS. HOWEVER, LOCAL VARIABLES, SUCH AS FIELD AREA, PLANT DENSITY AND PERCENTAGE OF FIELD BORDER WITH TREES, ALSO WERE RELATED TO DAMAGE.

OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CAROLINA PARAKEET'S RANGE WAS LIKELY MUCH SMALLER THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED, THAT THE EASTERN AND WESTERN SUBSPECIES OCCUPIED DIFFERENT CLIMATIC NICHES WITH BROAD GEOGRAPHICAL SEPARATION, AND THAT THE WESTERN SUBSPECIES WAS LIKELY A SEASONAL MIGRANT WHILE THE EASTERN SUBSPECIES WAS NOT. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE NOVELTY AND IMPORTANCE OF COLLECTING OCCURRENCE DATA FROM PUBLISHED OBSERVATIONS ON EXTINCT SPECIES, PROVIDING A STARTING POINT FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE FACTORS THAT DROVE THE CAROLINA PARAKEET TO EXTINCTION. MOREOVER, THE RECOVERY OF LOST AUTECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE COULD BENEFIT THE CONSERVATION OF OTHER PARROT SPECIES CURRENTLY IN DECLINE AND WOULD BE CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF POTENTIAL DE-EXTINCTION EFFORTS FOR THE CAROLINA PARAKEET.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"KEVIN.BURGIO@UCONN.EDU",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","FB7LW","10.1002/ece3.3135",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NSFNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DGE-0753455]","NSF, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: DGE-0753455",NA,"2045-7758","ECOL.

GIVEN THE MARKED PHENOTYPIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULATIONS OF BURROWING PARROTS WE HYPOTHESIZED AN IMPORTANT ROLE OF GEOGRAPHICAL AS WELL CLIMATIC HETEROGENEITY IN THE POPULATION STRUCTURE OF THIS SPECIES. LOCATIONSOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA. METHODSWE APPLIED A LANDSCAPE GENETICS APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE THE EXPLICIT PATTERNS OF GENETIC SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION BASED ON BOTH GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE USING SPATIAL PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (SPCA). THIS NECESSITATED A NOVEL STATISTICAL ESTIMATION OF THE SPECIES CLIMATIC LANDSCAPE, CONSIDERING TEMPERATURE- AND PRECIPITATION-BASED VARIABLES SEPARATELY TO EVALUATE THEIR WEIGHT IN SHAPING THE DISTRIBUTION OF GENETIC VARIATION IN OUR MODEL SYSTEM. RESULTSGEOGRAPHICAL AND CLIMATIC HETEROGENEITY SUCCESSFULLY EXPLAINED MOLECULAR VARIANCE IN BURROWING PARROTS. SPCA DIVIDED THE SPECIES DISTRIBUTION INTO TWO MAIN AREAS, PATAGONIA AND THE PRE-ANDES, WHICH WERE CONNECTED BY AN AREA OF GEOGRAPHICAL AND CLIMATIC TRANSITION. MOREOVER, SPCA REVEALED CRYPTIC AND CONSERVATION-RELEVANT GENETIC STRUCTURE: THE PRE-ANDEAN POPULATIONS AND THE TRANSITION LOCALITIES WERE EACH DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, EACH MANAGEMENT UNITS FOR CONSERVATION. MAIN CONCLUSIONSSPCA, A METHOD ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR SPATIAL GENETICS, ALLOWED US TO UNRAVEL THE GENETIC STRUCTURE RELATED TO SPATIAL AND CLIMATIC LANDSCAPES AND TO VISUALIZE THESE PATTERNS IN LANDSCAPE SPACE. THESE NOVEL CLIMATIC INFERENCES UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR MODIFIED SPCA APPROACH IN REVEALING HOW CLIMATIC VARIABLES CAN DRIVE CRYPTIC PATTERNS OF GENETIC STRUCTURE, MAKING THE APPROACH POTENTIALLY USEFUL IN THE STUDY OF ANY SPECIES DISTRIBUTED OVER A CLIMATICALLY HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPE.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"JUAN.F.MASELLO@BIO.UNI-GIESSEN.DE",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","CH8LY","10.1111/jbi.12487",NA,NA,"1365-2699",NA,NA,"WORLD PARROT TRUST; DEUTSCHE ORNITHOLOGEN-GESELLSCHAFT; LIZ CLAIBORNE ART ORTENBERG FOUNDATION; WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY","WE THANK ORLANDO AMAYA, BRENT BARRETT, JULIO BUFELLI, MIRTA CARBAJAL, GABRIEL CORTEZ, MARITZA CORTES, FRANCESCA CUNNINGHAME, MIGUEL ESCOBAR, MAURICIO FAILLA, ESTEBAN FERNANDEZ, VICTOR FRATTO, PABLO GIOVINE, PATRICIA GONZALEZ, GUILLERMO LUNA JORQUERA, MARIANO LINARES, FABIAN LLANOS, WALTER MARCIAL, GABRIELA MURGA VELASCO, JUANJO NAVARRO, SANDRA RIVERA, SERGIO SANCHEZ, LORENZO SYMPSON, ADALBERTO TAUX, RICARDO TORRES AND LUIS VALENZUELA RIQUELME FOR HELPING WITH SAMPLE COLLECTION, AND GERNOT SEGELBACHER AND NADINE KLAUKE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MICROSATELLITE LOCI.

TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES AND THREATS AFFECT THE USE OF FOREST ISLANDS BY PARROTS, WE APPLIED OCCUPANCY MODELING TO QUANTIFY USE AND DETECTION PROBABILITIES FOR 12 PARROT SPECIES ON 60 FOREST ISLANDS. THE PRESENCE OF URUCURI (ATTALEA PHALERATA) AND MACAW (ACROCOMIA ACULEATA) PALMS, THE NUMBER OF TREE CAVITIES ON THE ISLANDS, AND THE PRESENCE OF SELECTIVE LOGGING, AND FIRE WERE INCLUDED AS COVARIATES ASSOCIATED WITH AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES AND THREATS. THE MODEL-SELECTION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT BOTH RESOURCES AND THREATS VARIABLES EXPLAINED THE USE OF FOREST ISLANDS BY PARROTS. FOR MOST SPECIES, THE BEST MODELS CONFIRMED PREDICTIONS. THE NUMBER OF CAVITIES WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH USE OF FOREST ISLANDS BY 11 SPECIES. THE AREA OF THE ISLAND AND THE PRESENCE OF MACAW PALM SHOWED A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH THE PROBABILITY OF USE BY SEVEN AND FIVE SPECIES, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE SELECTIVE LOGGING AND FIRE SHOWED A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH FIVE AND SIX SPECIES, RESPECTIVELY. THE BLUE-THROATED MACAW (ARA GLAUCOGULARIS), THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED PARROT SPECIES ENDEMIC TO OUR STUDY AREA, WAS THE ONLY SPECIES THAT SHOWED A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH BOTH THREATS.

OUR RESULTS PREDICT A POTENTIAL POPULATION OF ABOUT 22 000 PARAKEET PAIRS, INDICATING THAT THEY COULD BECOME ONE OF THE MOST NUMEROUS CAVITY-NESTERS IN THE REGION. PARAKEET ABUNDANCE IS THE HIGHEST IN OLDER, MORE FRAGMENTED FOREST IN URBAN AREAS WHEREAS NUTHATCHES PREFER LARGER, OLD AND OAK-DOMINATED FORESTS. 4. OUR MODELS INDICATE THAT THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THEIR RANGE, AND IN A VARIETY OF HABITATS, PARAKEETS AND NUTHATCHES WILL COMPETE FOR NESTING CAVITIES, BUT AS THE COMPETITION STRENGTH IS ONLY MODERATE, THE TOTAL IMPACT OF PARAKEETS ON NUTHATCH POPULATIONS WILL BE LIMITED, WITH AT MOST ONE-THIRD OF THE POPULATION AT RISK. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS COMBINED WITH EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES OF COMPETITION STRENGTH CAN BE USED AS A GENERAL TOOL TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ESTABLISHED INVASIVE SPECIES. SUCH INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO MAKE EFFECTIVE DECISIONS ON HOW TO PRIORITIZE MANAGEMENT EFFORT AND RESOURCES ACROSS THE MULTITUDE OF INVASIVE SPECIES THAT CURRENTLY THREATEN NATIVE ECOSYSTEMS. FOR THE RING-NECKED PARAKEET, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT PARAKEETS POSE A THREAT LARGE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY AN ERADICATION CAMPAIGN WHERE THEY ARE CURRENTLY PRESENT.","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",NA,"DIEDERIK.STRUBBE@UA.AC.BE",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","589QP","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01808.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BELGIAN AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION; RESEARCH FOUNDATION-FLANDERSFWO","WE THANK THE AUTHORS OF THE FLEMISH BREEDING BIRD ATLAS AND CITIZEN SCIENTISTS FOR THE NUTHATCH DATA.

HOWEVER, EXISTING STUDIES HAVE TYPICALLY SHOWN THIS RELATIONSHIP WITHIN A SET OF SITES HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE OCCUPIED BY GROUND PARROTS, RATHER THAN DEMONSTRATING THAT FIRE HISTORY AFFECTS WHETHER A SITE IS OCCUPIED. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A LANDSCAPE-SCALE, TARGETED SURVEY OF GROUND PARROTS AT 80 HEATHLAND SITES BETWEEN MARLO AND MALLACOOTA, VICTORIA. SELECTION OF SITES WAS STRATIFIED BY COMBINATIONS OF TIME SINCE FIRE AND MODELLED PREDICTIONS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF GROUND PARROTS. ALL SITES WERE SAMPLED 10 TIMES IN LATE 2013 USING AUTOMATED SOUND RECORDERS, AND A SUBSET OF 23 SITES HAD AT LEAST ONE TRADITIONAL, OBSERVER-BASED PHYSICAL SURVEY. BOTH TIME SINCE FIRE AND THE SPECIES-DISTRIBUTION MODEL WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROBABILITY OF GROUND PARROTS OCCUPYING A SITE. THE MOST PARSIMONIOUS OCCUPANCY MODEL WAS APPLIED TO TWO EARLIER DATASETS FROM THE STUDY AREA, AND PROVIDED INDIRECT EVIDENCE FOR AN INFERRED DECLINE IN GROUND PARROT OCCUPANCY IN RECENT DECADES. LANDSCAPE MODELLING OF THE EXPECTED TOTAL AREA OCCUPIED BY GROUND PARROTS BETWEEN 1979 AND 2013 SUGGESTED A STRONG PEAK WOULD HAVE OCCURRED IN THE LATE 1990S; SUITABILITY OF HABITAT OVER MUCH OF THE LANDSCAPE IS NOW DECLINING. FINALLY, GIVEN THAT MANY AUSTRALIAN FAUNA SPECIES ARE RESPONSIVE TO FIRE, THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE MANAGEMENT OF SUCH SPECIES CAN BE TESTED EFFICIENTLY BY COMBINING LEGACY DATASETS AND LITERATURE WITH CONTEMPORARY DATA COLLECTION AND MODELLING METHODS.","UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",NA,"LUCAS.BLUFF@DELWP.VIC.GOV.AU",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","EJ4PN","10.1071/MU16014",NA,NA,"1448-5540",NA,NA,"VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT","THANKS TO NEVIL AMOS, MICK BRAMWELL, ROHAN BILNEY, LIAM FOGARTY, FIONA HAMILTON, STEPHEN HENRY, AND STEPHEN PLATT FOR IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS AT VARIOUS STAGES OF THIS PROJECT, AND IN PARTICULAR TO KIRRIN BROWN FOR MAJOR ASSISTANCE WITH DATA ENTRY AND SCREENING SOUND RECORDINGS FOR GROUND PARROT CALLS.

WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF CLEARFELLING ON BIRDS OF THE KARRI EUCALYPTUS DIVERSICOLOR FOREST IN SOUTH-WEST WESTERN AUSTRALIA OVER A 17-YEAR PERIOD, AND A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF BOTH CLEARFELLED AND NATURALLY REGENERATED KARRI STANDS AGED FROM 0 TO 146 YEARS. 3. ONE-THIRD OF SPECIES STILL HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ABUNDANCE 14 YEARS AFTER DISTURBANCE CEASED, ALTHOUGH ALL AFFECTED SPECIES MADE LIMITED USE OF REGENERATING FOREST. 4. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN BIRD COMMUNITY STRUCTURE SHOWED THAT THE EFFECTS OF DISTURBANCE WERE STILL EVIDENT 14 YEARS AFTER CLEARFELLING. CLEARFELLING MAY ALSO HAVE PRODUCED SOME TEMPORARY CHANGES IN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN ADJACENT UNLOGGED FOREST. 5. SPECIES RICHNESS AND TOTAL ABUNDANCE OF BIRDS DECLINED BY 58\% AND 96\%, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER CLEARFELLING, AND 14 YEARS AFTER LOGGING WERE STILL 17\% AND 55\% BELOW LEVELS IN ADJACENT UNDISTURBED FOREST. DURING THIS EARLY SUCCESSIONAL PHASE BOTH MEASURES INCREASED AS A SIMPLE FUNCTION OF STAND AGE. SPECIES RICHNESS OF REGROWTH REACH-OD THAT OF OLD-GROWTH AT 30-50, YEARS AND TOTAL ABUNDANCE OF ALL BIRD SPECIES IN REGROWTH WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF OLD-GROWTH AFTER APPROXIMATELY 70 YEARS. 6.

FOR MANY UNCOMMON SPECIES, TRYING TO ESTIMATE CHANGES IN ABUNDANCE IS PROBLEMATIC AND LIKELY TO REQUIRE REPLICATION WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE IN FIELD SITUATIONS WHERE LOGGED AND UNLOGGED FORESTS ARE COMPARED.

ETHNOBOTANICAL STUDIES OF THE REGION ARE AMONG THE MOST COMPLETE IN MEXICO; CONTRARILY, ETHNOZOOLOGICAL STUDIES ARE STILL LIMITED. BUT INFORMATION ON BOTH FLORA AND FAUNA USE AND MANAGEMENT IS RELEVANT FOR UNDERSTANDING LOCAL CULTURAL AND ECOLOGICAL ISSUES, AND FOR PLANNING INTEGRAL STRATEGIES OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. OUR STUDY FOCUSED ON ANALYZING KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF ANIMALS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH FAUNISTIC MANAGEMENT BY THE CUICATEC, AN ANCIENT HUMAN CULTURE WHOSE DISTRIBUTION IS RESTRICTED TO THE REGION. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT WILD ANIMALS STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIET, MEDICINE, AND SPIRITUAL LIFE OF THE CUICATEC PEOPLE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECTED TO FIND A GRADIENT OF INTERACTIONS, FROM SIMPLE GATHERING AND HUNTING TO COMMUNITARIAN REGULATIONS OF USE, SPECIALIZED MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES AND CARE, NURTURING, AND DOMESTICATION OF ANIMALS. SUCH GRADIENT OF MANAGEMENT INTERACTIONS WOULD BE INFLUENCED PROPORTIONALLY WITH CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC VALUES, VIABILITY MAINTENANCE, AND SCARCITY OF ANIMALS. METHODS OUR STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN SAN LORENZO PAPALO, OAXACA. WE CONDUCTED SURVEYS AND SEMI-STRUCTURED AND OPEN INTERVIEWS TO PEOPLE TO DOCUMENT THE CUICATEC NOMENCLATURE, CLASSIFICATION, USE, AND MANAGEMENT OF FAUNA, AS WELL AS THEIR PERCEPTIONS ABOUT ABUNDANCE, RISKS OF DISAPPEARANCE, AND AVAILABILITY OF WILD ANIMALS. WE USED IMAGES OF ANIMAL SPECIES REPORTED FOR THE AREA AS COMMUNICATION STIMULI FOR CONFIRMING THEIR LOCAL PRESENCE. ALSO, WE RECORDED SKINS AND SKULLS USED AS TROPHIES AND ORNAMENTAL OBJECTS, PAWPRINTS, AND EXCRETES. THROUGH FREE LISTING, WE IDENTIFIED THE MOST MEANINGFUL SPECIES OF DIFFERENT ANIMAL GROUPS. WHENEVER POSSIBLE, WE EVALUATED AMOUNTS OF ANIMALS OBTAINED FROM THE WILD, AND FOR SOME SPECIES, WE COMPARED THIS INFORMATION WITH DATA ON THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE EVALUATED THROUGH ECOLOGICAL SAMPLING, TO EXPLORE INDICATORS ON THEIR SUSTAINABLE USE. RESULTS THE CUICATEC NAME ALL ANIMALS THROUGH THE TERM I-TI AND CLASSIFY THEM IN SEVERAL GROUPS OF VERTEBRATES, ARTHROPODS, AND MOLLUSKS, SOME OF THEM COINCIDING WITH THE FORMAL TAXONOMY AND SOME OTHERS BASED ON THEIR SOCIAL-CULTURAL ROLE. THE MOST MEANINGFUL ANIMALS ARE 23 SPECIES OF EDIBLE ORGANISMS, OUTSTANDINGLY THE CHICATANA ANTS (ATTA MEXICANA) AND THE CUETLA LEPIDOPTERA LARVAE (ARSENURA ARMIDA), THE LIZARD SCELOPORUS GRAMMICUS, AND AMONG THE MAMMALS SOME SQUIRRELS (SCIURUS SPP.), BADGERS (NASUA NARICA), AND DEER (ODOCOILEUS VIRGINIANUS). SOME SPECIES WERE REPORTED TO BE USED FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES, AMONG THEM OPOSSUM (DIDELPHIS SPP.) AND MACAWS (ARA MILITARIS), USED TO EASE CHILDBIRTHS, BUT THIS USE ALMOST DISAPPEARED. LOCAL PERCEPTION OF AVAILABILITY OF ANIMAL RESOURCES IS ASSOCIATED TO FOREST CONSERVATION. REGULATIONS FOR PROTECTING FORESTS AND THE MOST USED ANIMAL SPECIES WERE RECORDED; THE RULES ARE MAINLY ASSOCIATED TO HUNTING AND GATHERING SEASONS, RESPECTING FEMALES OF VERTEBRATE SPECIES, AND PERMITS FOR GATHERING AND HUNTING GIVEN BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES. NURTURING OF ANIMALS WAS RECORDED IN BIRD AND MAMMAL SPECIES, BUT IN NO CASE, THEIR BREEDING WAS ACHIEVED. CONCLUSIONS ANIMALS ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE CUICATEC CULTURE AND SUBSISTENCE, COMPLEMENTING THEIR DIET BASED ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. ANIMALS USED AS MEDICINE WERE STILL REPORTED BUT SUBSTITUTED BY MODERN MEDICINE. THERE IS A CONSENSUS ABOUT THE NEED TO CONSERVE FORESTS TO ENSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF ANIMALS, WHICH ARE VALUED AS PART OF NATURE, THE BEAUTY OF THEIR TERRITORY, AND CULTURE. COMMUNITARIAN REGULATIONS ARE THE MAIN WAYS FOR CONSERVING FAUNA, BUT LOCAL TECHNIQUES OF ANIMAL MANAGEMENT MAY HELP IN DESIGNING CONSERVATION STRATEGIES.","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","58","ACASAS@CIECO.UNAM.MX",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","JR8DD","10.1186/s13002-019-0340-1",NA,NA,"1746-4269",NA,NA,"POSGRADO EN CIENCIAS BIOLOGICAS AT THE UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL AUTONOMA DE MEXICO (UNAM); CONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA (CONACYT, MEXICO)CONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA (CONACYT) [A1-S-14306]; DGAPA, UNAMUNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL AUTONOMA DE MEXICO [IN206217]","THE AUTHORS THANK THE POSGRADO EN CIENCIAS BIOLOGICAS AT THE UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL AUTONOMA DE MEXICO (UNAM) FOR SUPPORTING MSC STUDIES FOR THE FIRST AUTHOR.

WE DETERMINED FLOWERING AND FRUITING PHENOLOGY, AND AVAILABILITY OF TREE-CAVITIES AND SNAGS IN DECIDUOUS AND SEMI-DECIDUOUS TROPICAL DRY FOREST FROM 2009 TO 2016, PRIOR-TO AND FOLLOWING LANDFALL BY HURRICANES JOVA (CATEGORY 2) IN 2011 AND PATRICIA (CATEGORY 4) IN 2015. WE ALSO EVALUATED REPRODUCTION OF THE THREATENED LILAC-CROWNED AMAZON (AMAZONA FINSCHI) THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD. FLOWERING AND FRUITING PHENOLOGY WAS REDUCED DURING THE FIRST YEAR POST-HURRICANES, BUT THE MAJOR HURRICANE PATRICIA HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPACT ON FRUIT AND FLOWER ABUNDANCE THAN THE MINOR HURRICANE JOVA. ARIMA TIME SERIES MODELLING INDICATED THAT DECIDUOUS FOREST RECOVERED PHENOLOGICAL CYCLES BY THE SECOND-YEAR POST-HURRICANE JOVA, BUT SEMI-DECIDUOUS FOREST DEMONSTRATED A LEVEL SHIFT IN FRUITING PHENOLOGY AFTER LANDFALL BY THIS MINOR HURRICANE. SUBSEQUENT LANDFALL BY THE MAJOR HURRICANE PATRICIA THEN ALSO LED TO A LEVEL SHIFT IN FRUITING PHENOLOGY OF DECIDUOUS FOREST. TREE-CAVITY AND SNAG RESOURCES WERE REDUCED BY HALF POST-HURRICANE JOVA, AND REMAINING TREE-CAVITIES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY WIDER ENTRANCES, WHILE SNAGS WERE OF LARGER DIAMETERS. HURRICANE JOVA CAUSED THE LOSS OF 35.6\% OF LILAC-CROWNED AMAZON NEST-SITES, WHEREAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER 61.5\% OF PARROT NEST-SITES WERE LOST AFTER HURRICANE PATRICIA. NEW NEST-CAVITIES USED BY PARROTS AFTER HURRICANE JOVA HAD SIGNIFICANTLY WIDER ENTRANCES COMPARED TO NEST-CAVITIES USED PRIOR TO HURRICANE IMPACTS. IN THE FIRST BREEDING SEASON POST-HURRICANES, LILAC-CROWNED AMAZONS DELAYED NEST INITIATION, FEW PAIRS NESTED, AND REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT WAS LOW. PARROT REPRODUCTION RECOVERED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS POST-HURRICANE JOVA, BUT PARROT REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT REMAINED AMONG THE LOWEST RECORDED FOR THE SPECIES IN THE SECOND YEAR POST-HURRICANE PATRICIA. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DECIDUOUS FOREST MAY BE RESILIENT TO LOW-LEVEL HURRICANE IMPACTS, SUCH AS HURRICANE JOVA, BUT SEMI-DECIDUOUS FOREST DID NOT RECOVER OVER THE FIVE YEARS AFTER HURRICANE LANDFALL, AND IS A PRIORITY FOR RESTORATION MANAGEMENT.

THIS SUGGESTS EITHER THAT, AT LEAST FOR THESE DATA, AS PRESENTLY FORMULATED MID-DOMAIN MODELS ARE TOO SIMPLISTIC, OR THAT IN PRACTICE THE MID-DOMAIN EFFECT IS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN DETERMINING GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION IN DIVERSITY.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"P.KOLEFF@SHEFFIELD.AC.UK",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-26","452VY","10.1034/j.1600-0587.2001.240312.x",NA,NA,"1600-0587",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0906-7590","ECOGRAPHY","ECOGRAPHY","ENGLISH",NA,"JUN",NA,"56","3",NA,NA,NA,"341-351","WILEY","BIODIVERSITY \& CONSERVATION; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",NA,NA,73,"LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS IN DIVERSITY: REAL PATTERNS AND RANDOM MODELS","ARTICLE","ISI000169881400012","0","33","24","BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY",2001,"KOLEFF, P (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SHEFFIELD, DEPT ANIM \& PLANT SCI, BIODIVERS \& MACROECOL GRP, SHEFFIELD S10 2TN, S YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","ISI","BLACKBURN TIM M., 1996, BIODIVERSITY LETTERS, V3, P44, DOI 10.2307/2999768; BLACKBURN TM, 1998, IBIS, V140, P626, DOI 10.1111/J.1474-919X.1998.TB04708.X; BLACKBURN TM, 1997, EVOL ECOL, V11, P195, DOI 10.1023/A:1018451916734; BLACKBURN TM, 1996, PHILOS T ROY SOC B, V351, P897, DOI 10.1098/RSTB.1996.0083; BLACKBURN TM, 1996, OIKOS, V77, P146, DOI 10.2307/3545594; CODY M.L., 1975, P214; COLWELL RK, 2000, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V15, P70, DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01767-X; COLWELL RK, 1994, AM NAT, V144, P570, DOI 10.1086/285695; COLWELL RK, 1999, RANGEMODEL MONTE CAR; CURRIE DJ, 1991, AM NAT, V137, P27, DOI 10.1086/285144; DAVIDOWITZ G, 1998, J BIOGEOGR, V25, P553, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2699.1998.2530553.X; GASTON KEVIN J., 1996, P202; GASTON KJ, 1996, PROG PHYS GEOG, V20, P466, DOI 10.1177/030913339602000406; GASTON KJ, 1999, OIKOS, V84, P309, DOI 10.2307/3546727; GASTON KJ, 1998, TRENDS ECOL EVOL, V13, P70, DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01236-6; GASTON KJ, 2000, PATTERN PROCESS MACR; GAULD ID, 1995, HYMENOPTERA COSTA RI, P13; HARRISON S, 1992, J ANIM ECOL, V61, P151, DOI 10.2307/5518; HECNAR SJ, 1999, ECOGRAPHY, V22, P436, DOI 10.1111/J.1600-0587.1999.TB00580.X; JABLONSKI D, 1993, NATURE, V364, P142, DOI 10.1038/364142A0; JUNIPER T., 1998, PARROTS GUIDE PARROT; KAUFMAN DM, 1998, J BIOGEOGR, V25, P795, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2699.1998.2540795.X; LEES DC, 1999, BIOL J LINN SOC, V67, P529, DOI 10.1111/J.1095-8312.1999.TB01945.X; LEES DC, 1996, COLLOQ SEMI, P479; LEITH H, 1989, ECOSYSTEMS WORLD B, V14; LYONS SK, 1997, OIKOS, V79, P568, DOI 10.2307/3546901; MAGURRAN A.

PARROTS CAN TRANSPORT LARGE FRUITS USING THEIR BEAKS, BUT HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED AS SEED DISPERSERS. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THREE MACAWS (ARA ARARAUNA, A. GLAUCOGULARIS AND A.

MACAWS DISPERSED FRUITS AT HIGH RATES (75-100\% OF FRUITS) TO DISTANT (UP TO 1200 M) PERCHING TREES, WHERE THEY CONSUMED THE PULP AND DISCARDED ENTIRE SEEDS, CONTRIBUTING TO FOREST REGENERATION AND CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN DISTANT FORESTS ISLANDS. THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF IMMATURE PALMS WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED TO THE PROXIMITY TO MACAWS' PERCHING TREES AND NEGATIVELY TO THE PROXIMITY TO CATTLE PATHS. THE DISPERSER ROLE OF LIVESTOCK, PRESUMABLY A SUBSTITUTE FOR EXTINCT MEGAFAUNA, HAD LITTLE EFFECT DUE TO SOIL COMPACTION, TRAMPLING AND HERBIVORY.

THE BEST MODEL INCORPORATED QUADRATIC TERMS FOR ROAD DENSITY AND TREE COVER, AND INTERACTION TERMS, AS WELL AS SEASON AS A CATEGORICAL VARIABLE. PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE OF RAINBOW LORIKEETS WAS HIGHEST AT MEDIUM TREE COVER (40\% TO 70\% OF THE SITE COVERED) AND MEDIUM ROAD DENSITY (9\% TO 12\% OF THE SURROUNDING AREA COVERED BY ROADS).

WE EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF THESE POTENTIAL ERRORS USING A MULTI-YEAR DATA SET ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MIGRATORY AND ENDANGERED SWIFT PARROT (LATHAMUS DISCOLOR). WE SIMULTANEOUSLY ACCOUNT FOR THESE EFFECTS BY EXTENDING A ZERO-INFLATED BINOMIAL (ZIB) FRAMEWORK TO ALLOW THE INCLUSION OF SEMIPARAMETRIC, SMOOTH SPATIAL TERMS INTO BOTH THE OCCUPANCY AND DETECTION COMPONENT OF THE MODEL, IN A MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD FRAMEWORK EASILY IMPLEMENTED IN COMMON SOFTWARE. THIS APPROACH ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD MODEL SELECTION PROCEDURES.

EXPLICITLY RECOGNISING SPATIAL VARIABILITY THROUGH THE INCLUSION OF SEMIPARAMETRIC SPATIALLY SMOOTH TERMS IN THE ZIBS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED MODELS IN ALL YEARS, AND WE SUGGEST THIS PREDICTOR IS AN EFFECTIVE PROXY FOR UNMEASURED ENVIRONMENTAL COVARIATES OR CONSPECIFIC ATTRACTION. IMPORTANTLY, THE SPATIALLY EXPLICIT ZIBS PREDICTED FEWER OCCUPIED SITES IN MORE DEFINED AREAS COMPARED TO NON-SPATIAL ZIBS. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF PREDICTED DISTRIBUTIONS IN LAND MANAGEMENT, HABITAT PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION OF SWIFT PARROTS, THESE MODELS SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN UNDERSTANDING AND DESCRIBING THEIR ECOLOGY.

WE ALSO EVALUATED THE JOINT PRESENCE OF THE THREE MACAW SPECIES AND ESTIMATED THEIR ABUNDANCE IN OCCUPIED AREAS. WE MODELLED OCCUPANCY AND DETECTION FOR THE THREE MACAW SPECIES BY COMBINING SEVERAL SITE AND VISIT COVARIATES AND WE DESCRIBED THEIR CONDITIONAL OCCUPANCY. MACAWS OCCUPIED TWO THIRDS OF THE SURVEYED AREA AND AT LEAST TWO SPECIES OCCURRED TOGETHER IN ONE THIRD OF THIS AREA. PROBABILITY OF DETECTION WAS 0.48-0.86. FOR EACH MACAW SPECIES, OCCUPANCY WAS AFFECTED BY THE ABUNDANCE OF THE OTHER TWO SPECIES, THE RICHNESS OF CAVITY-NESTING SPECIES, AND THE DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST VILLAGE. WE IDENTIFIED KEY PRIORITY AREAS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THESE MACAWS. THE FLEXIBILITY OF OCCUPANCY METHODS PROVIDES AN EFFICIENT TOOL FOR MONITORING MACAW OCCUPANCY AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL, FACILITATING PREDICTION OF THE RANGE OF MACAW SPECIES AT A LARGE NUMBER OF SITES, WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE EFFORT.

AMONG BIRDS, THE WIDELY INTRODUCED RING-NECKED PARAKEET PSITTACULA KRAMERI LOCALLY AFFECTS CAVITY-NESTING COMMUNITIES THROUGH COMPETITION FOR SUITABLE TREE CAVITIES, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT SUCH COMPETITION TRANSLATES INTO POPULATION DECLINES OF NATIVE SPECIES. HERE, WE STUDIED THE POTENTIAL FOR NEST SITE COMPETITION BETWEEN RING-NECKED PARAKEETS AND THE NATIVE SCOPS OWL OTUS SCOPS, A SMALL NOCTURNAL MIGRATORY RAPTOR, BY COMPARING THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE NEST SITE LOCATIONS OF THE RAPTOR BEFORE (2002) AND AFTER (2015) THE PARAKEET INVASION. PRE-INVASION NESTING SITES OF SCOPS OWLS (2002) STRONGLY COINCIDED WITH THOSE SELECTED BY RING-NECKED PARAKEETS, BUT ALTHOUGH BOTH PARAKEET AND SCOPS OWL POPULATIONS INCREASED DURING THE STUDY PERIOD, THIS WAS NO LONGER TRUE FOR 2015. RING-NECKED PARAKEETS TOOK OVER SEVERAL CAVITIES FORMERLY OCCUPIED BY SCOPS OWLS, AND LAND-USE DATA SUGGEST THAT BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER OVERALL BREEDING DENSITIES IN 2015, SCOPS OWLS WERE FORCED TO OCCUPY SUBOPTIMAL BREEDING HABITATS TO MINIMIZE NEST SITE COMPETITION WITH INVASIVE PARAKEETS. RING-NECKED PARAKEETS START BREEDING EARLY IN THE SEASON, A BEHAVIOUR ENABLING THEM TO SECURE THE BEST NEST SITES FIRST, BEFORE THE OWLS RETURN FROM THEIR WINTERING GROUNDS. OUR STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THAT LOCALLY OBSERVED COMPETITION NOT NECESSARILY IMPACTS ON POPULATION DYNAMICS OF COMPETING SPECIES AND THUS WARNS AGAINST UNCRITICAL EXTRAPOLATION OF SMALLER SCALE STUDIES FOR ASSESSING INVASIVE SPECIES RISKS AT LARGER SPATIAL SCALES. NONETHELESS, GIVEN THE INCREASING NUMBER OF STUDIES DEMONSTRATING ITS COMPETITIVE CAPACITIES, MONITORING OF RING-NECKED PARAKEET POPULATIONS IS PRUDENT AND MITIGATION MEASURES (SUCH AS MOUNTING OF MAN-MADE NEST-BOXES, WHICH ARE USED BY SCOPS OWLS, BUT NOT BY PARAKEETS) MAY BE JUSTIFIED WHEN THE PARAKEETS ARE LIKELY TO INVADE AREAS HARBOURING CAVITY-NESTERS OF CONSERVATION CONCERN.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"MORIEMILIANO@TISCALI.IT",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","FK2NN","10.1111/acv.12334",NA,NA,"1469-1795",NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COST ACTIONEUROPEAN COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (COST) [ES1304]","THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY EUROPEAN COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COST ACTION ES1304 (PARROTNET) FOR THE REALIZATION OF THIS PAPER.

AFTER 1987, NEW RECORDS EXTEND THE KNOWN DISTRIBUTION CONSIDERABLY TO THE SOUTHWEST, WHEREAS REGIONS AT THE EASTERN END OF THE RANGE DO NOT CONTAIN RECENT RECORDS. WE INTERPRET THE FORMER AS IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE HISTORICAL DISTRIBUTION BASED ON INCREASED SAMPLING, AND THE LATTER AS A GENUINE RANGE RETRACTION, BEST EXPLAINED BY DEFORESTATION IN THAT REGION. WE ESTIMATE THE SPECIES' CURRENT AREA OF OCCURRENCE AT 340,000 KM(2), EMBRACING LESS THAN 65\% OF ITS ORIGINAL RANGE. DISTRIBUTION MODELS PREDICT A POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE GOLDEN PARAKEET THROUGHOUT A REGION OF RELATIVELY LOW HUMIDITY, AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN LOWLAND AND SUBMONTANE RAINFOREST AT THE BORDER OF THE BRAZILIAN SHIELD. THIS DISTRIBUTION COINCIDES WITH THE COLONIZATION FRONTIER (''ARC OF DEFORESTATION'') IN THE AMAZON, WHICH PLACES THE SPECIES' FUTURE IN SERIOUS RISK. EXISTING AND PLANNED PARKS AND RESERVES IN THE TAPAJOS RIVER REGION APPEAR TO OFFER THE BEST HOPE FOR PROTECTION OF CURRENTLY KNOWN POPULATIONS.

A COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE ON THE WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION OF EIGHT SPECIES OF NON-NATIVE LOVEBIRDS (INCLUDING ESTABLISHMENT SUCCESS AND POPULATION SIZE FROM 21 COUNTRIES SPANNING 27 YEARS) WAS COMPILED. WE COMBINED CLIMATE-BASED SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL NICHE ANALYSES TO EVALUATE ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY AND POTENTIAL NICHE SHIFTS IN THE INTRODUCED RANGE OF LOVEBIRDS. THEN, WE TESTED WHETHER COMBINING HABITAT SUITABILITY WITH INFORMATION ON TRADE, INTRODUCTION EFFORT AND BREEDING ORIGIN (CAPTIVE-BRED OR WILD-CAUGHT) OF IMPORTED BIRDS CAN IMPROVE MODEL PREDICTIONS AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL. ALTHOUGH CLIMATE-BASED MODELS FIT WELL WITH THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION OF NON-NATIVE LOVEBIRDS AT 5-ARCMINUTE RESOLUTION AND SIGNIFICANT NICHE SIMILARITY WAS FOUND FOR 3 SPECIES, WE ALSO OBSERVED SUCCESSFUL ESTABLISHMENTS IN AREAS CLIMATICALLY DISTINCT FROM THOSE OCCUPIED IN NATIVE RANGES. AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL, ONLY A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF ESTABLISHED POPULATIONS AND BOTH THE NUMBER OF INTRODUCTION SITES AND THE YEAR OF FIRST IMPORTATION WAS OBSERVED. A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF BREEDING ORIGIN WAS NOT FOUND, BUT MOST TRADED BIRDS HAD A CAPTIVE-BRED ORIGIN. OUR WORK CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROWING EVIDENCE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE INVASION PROCESS AND THE DIFFICULTY OF PRE-INTRODUCTION INVASION ASSESSMENTS BASED SOLELY ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RECIPIENT ENVIRONMENTS FOR THE AGAPORNIS SPECIES. SURVEILLANCE PROTOCOLS SHOULD BE APPLIED TO BOTH WILD-CAUGHT AND CAPTIVE-BRED LOVEBIRDS, AS ADDITIONAL DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE TO BETTER TEASE APART THE ROLE OF ORIGIN IN THOSE SPECIES.","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,"MORIEMILIANO@TISCALI.IT",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","KS6FF","10.1007/s10530-019-02100-y",NA,NA,"1573-1464",NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COST ACTION (PARROTNET)EUROPEAN COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (COST) [ES1304]; FEDER FUNDS THROUGH THE OPERATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS FACTORS PROGRAM ``COMPETE''; NATIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (FCT) [PTDC/AAG-GLO/0463/2014-POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016583]; FCTPORTUGUESE FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY [SFRH/BPD/93079/2013]; H2020MSCA-IF-2016 FELLOWSHIP [752149]","WE THANK LEONARDO ANCILLOTTO FOR USEFUL RECOMMENDATIONS AND HELP IN DATA COLLECTION.

THE ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS WERE GENERATED WITH THE MAXENT ALGORITHM. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION WERE USED, AS WELL AS AN ANALYSIS OF VEGETATION AND AVAILABILITY OF PROTECTED AREAS ESTABLISHED UNTIL 2015. THE MODELS DID NOT PRESENT OMISSION ERRORS AND ALLOW TO HAVE UPDATED ESTIMATES FOR EACH SPECIES. THE SPECIES WITH THE GREATEST POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION WAS AMAZONA ALBIFRONS, AND AMAZONA AUROPALLIATA HAD THE SMALLEST ONE. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALL THE SPECIES HAVE LOST SUITABLE HABITAT AREA, ESPECIALLY ARA MACAO, AMAZONA AUROPALLIATA AND A. ORATRIX. ALTHOUGH TROPICAL FORESTS ARE PRESENT ON MOST SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS, TEMPERATE FORESTS HAD A HIGH COVER PERCENTAGE FOR 6 SPECIES. THE PROPORTION OF PROTECTED AREA FOR EACH SPECIES WAS HIGHER WHEN COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS ESTIMATES FROM THE YEAR 2000. THE PRECISE ESTIMATE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEXICAN PSITTACIDAE HAS INTERNATIONAL CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS, AS 6 SPECIES ARE ENDEMIC AND 4 SPECIES MAY PRESENT THEIR GREATER POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION IN MEXICO ACCORDING TO IUCN INFORMATION. DUE TO HABITAT LOSS SOME SPECIES HAVE A HIGH VULNERABILITY, PRESENT AND FUTURE, MAKING IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY AND PATTERNS OF POPULATION ABUNDANCE. THE USE OF ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS TO EVALUATE DISTRIBUTIONAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE MAY BE ALSO NECESSARY.

HOWEVER, THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF REINTRODUCTION RELIES ON IDENTIFICATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE HABITAT AND AREAS THAT WILL REMAIN, OR BECOME, HABITAT IN THE FUTURE. COMMONLY, A SHORT-TERM VIEW IS TAKEN, FOCUSING ON OBVIOUS AND ASSUMED THREATS SUCH AS PREDATORS AND HABITAT DEGRADATION. HOWEVER, IN AREAS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE CHANGE, CHALLENGES INCLUDE CORRECTLY IDENTIFYING VARIABLES THAT DEFINE HABITAT, AND CONSIDERING PROBABLE CHANGES OVER TIME. THIS POSES CHALLENGES WITH SPECIES SUCH AS THE WESTERN GROUND PARROT PEZOPORUS FLAVIVENTRIS, WHICH WAS ONCE RELATIVELY COMMON IN NEAR-COASTAL SOUTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AN AREA SUBJECT TO MAJOR CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS SPECIES HAS DECLINED TO ONE SMALL POPULATION, ESTIMATED TO COMPRISE < 150 INDIVIDUALS. REASONS FOR THE DECLINE INCLUDE ALTERED FIRE REGIMES, INTRODUCED PREDATORS AND HABITAT CLEARING. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW POPULATIONS IS A HIGH PRIORITY, BUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH A RAPIDLY CHANGING CLIMATE HAS AFFECTED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT, THIS SPECIES REMAINS LARGELY CONJECTURE, AND UNDERSTANDING PROBABLE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE PRIORITIZATION OF POTENTIAL REINTRODUCTION SITES. WE DEVELOPED HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS AND USED THESE TO INVESTIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON CURRENT AND HISTORICAL DISTRIBUTIONS, AND IDENTIFY LOCATIONS THAT WILL REMAIN, OR BECOME, BIOCLIMATICALLY SUITABLE HABITAT IN THE FUTURE. THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO AN EXPERT PANEL TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE AREAS SUITABLE FOR SITE-SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT AND/OR TRANSLOCATION.","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","PII S0030605318000923","SHAUNECOLOGIST@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,NA,"2020-10-23","JU4IH","10.1017/S0030605318000923",NA,NA,"1365-3008",NA,NA,"WESTERN AUSTRALIAN DEPARTMENT OF BIODIVERSITY, CONSERVATION AND ATTRACTIONS (DBCA); WESTERN AUSTRALIAN STATE NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM; SOUTH COAST NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT INC.; COMMONWEALTH BIODIVERSITY FUND; FRIENDS OF THE WESTERN GROUND PARROT; DBCA; EDITH COWAN UNIVERSITY","DATA COLLATION WAS SUPPORTED BY THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN DEPARTMENT OF BIODIVERSITY, CONSERVATION AND ATTRACTIONS (DBCA).
