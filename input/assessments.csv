Its overall non-breeding range may be determined by distribution of marri, though it does occur in apple and pear orchards and occasionally in wandoo <em>E. wandoo</em> woodland (Higgins 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species mainly feeds on the seeds and flowers of marri, as well as the seeds of <em>Banksia</em>, <em>Hakea</em> and <em>Dryandra</em> species, <em>Erodium botrys</em> and jarrah, and additionally takes insect larvae (DEC, Western Australia 2007a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It also feeds on apple and pear seeds (DEC, Western Australia 2007a)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong> and is considered a pest owing to the damage it causes when extracting seeds from crops in commercial orchards (Chapman 2007, DEC, Western Australia 2007a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Damage to commercial fruit crops is thought to be higher during local or seasonal shortages of marri seeds, and could be related to destruction of this habitat (DEC, Western Australia 2007a)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species may live for 25 to 50 years in the wild (DEC, Western Australia 2007a)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>. It breeds in large hollows of old karri, marri and jarrah (Higgins 1999, DEC, Western Australia 2007a)<strong><sup></sup></strong> within heavily forested areas (Higgins 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, although recent work suggests that there are very few nest sites, that breeding occurs very infrequently and that many nest hollows are being taken over by feral bees (P. Mawson <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Breeding data has indicated that pairs raise, on average, 0.6 chicks each year. In years of poor marri seed production, the population may fail to raise any young at all (DEC, Western Australia 2007a)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>.

Nest hollow shortage is considered the principal threat, as suitable hollows are considered scarce, only forming in trees at least 130 to 220 years of age, many of which have been preferentially felled (Chapman 2007). The past and present impacts of logging for marri, initially for woodchips and now for furniture grade sawlogs, are reducing the availability of food and nesting trees. The impact of logging and woodchipping has not been quantified. Although logging of old growth forest in the south-west has now stopped, habitat loss is still likely to be causing population declines. Feral European honey bees <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apis mellifera </span>have been found to occupy many potential nest sites, and are known to have caused the loss of chicks and killed a brooding female (P.

It is not known whether losses from shooting exceed productivity (P. Mawson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2004). Continued loss of forest to mining in some areas is also an issue, since revegetation will have no impact on conservation outcomes within the lifespan of this species (P.

The species has also been recorded damaging persimmon and nut crops and the shoots of trees in orchards (Department of Environment and Conservation, Western Australia 2012)<strong></strong>.

Observations suggest that pairs remain together until the death of one of the partners (Saunders 1982)<strong></strong>. The eggs are usually laid between early July and late September (Saunders 1990, Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2013)<strong></strong>, with timing of egg-laying being strongly influenced by rainfall in the first half of autumn (Saunders et al. 2013). Egg laying may continue into October or November (Saunders and Ingram 1998,&#160;Saunders <em>et al. </em>2013). Less than half of the nest hollows available in an area of breeding habitat may remain unoccupied due to aggressive interactions between females during the selection and preparation of hollows (Saunders 1982)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It is known that some females return to the same nest hollows in successive years&#160;provided they have been successful the previous breeding season, and the hollow is unoccupied when they return to breed&#160;(Saunders 1982, 1990)<strong></strong>. The species usually lays two eggs on average up to eight days apart. The second to hatch usually dies within 48 hours (Saunders 1982, Saunders <em>et al. </em>2014a)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In good seasons experienced females may fledge both nestlings (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2014a). The incubation period is 28-29 days (Saunders 1979b, 1982)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Successful fledging of two chicks occurs in up to 6% of nesting attempts (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Juveniles remain with their parents until they return to the breeding area at the start of the following season, and in some cases may associate with their parents for longer (Saunders 1982)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

In the district of Coomallo Creek, between 1969 and 1982, a decrease in the percentage cover of native vegetation from 67% to 34% coincided with a decrease in the breeding population of the species by one third (Saunders 1986)<strong></strong>. As habitat is cleared, the species is likely to become more susceptible to human-related threats such as collisions with cars and shooting (Saunders 1982,&#160;Saunders <em>et al. </em>2003, Le Souef 2012). Many patches of native habitat are situated near human settlements and traversed by roads and railway lines (Saunders 1990)<strong></strong>, and birds may become increasingly reliant on commercial crops (Saunders 1982, Jackson 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. As habitat becomes patchy, local populations may fail to locate suitable feeding areas (Saunders 1990)<strong></strong>. The species's long pair bonds and high breeding-site fidelity may mean that birds do not disperse following disturbance and may persist at the same breeding sites until all habitat in an area is cleared or the local population dies out (Saunders 1982, 1986)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Clearing for agriculture in the wheatbelt has left little kwongan vegetation, which the species requires for feeding, adjacent to the woodland patches in which it nests (Saunders and Ingram 1998)<strong></strong>. Nest-hollow availability is almost certainly limiting breeding as loss of large natural hollows exceeds the creation of hollows in native vegetation (Saunders <em>et al. </em>2014b). In addition, competition with feral bees and other cockatoo species has adversely affected breeding Carnaby's cockatoos (Saunders 1974, 1982, 1990, Saunders <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014c). For example, the Galah&#160;<em><span class=""SpellE"">Eolophus&#160;<span class=""SpellE"">roseicapilla</span></em>&#160;has been recorded damaging&#160;unguarded eggs, and such interference caused the failure of 7% of recorded nesting attempts in one area during the 1970s (Saunders 1990)<strong></strong>. Much of the feeding habitat of non-breeding birds has been cleared, and many birds throughout their range now seasonally feed on pines (Stock <em>et al. </em>2013) and native proteaceous species (Johnston <em>et al</em>. 2016). On the Swan Coastal Plain, pines provide much of the birds' food (Perry 1948, Saunders 1974b, 1980). These pines have now reached maturity, and are being harvested and most will not be replaced, resulting in a food shortage (Valentine and Stock 2008, Stock <em>et al. 2</em>013). A 'Green Growth Plan' for urban development in Perth that ignores the needs of this species is also a threat (Douglas and Peck 2016). Nest-robbing for domestic trade has declined, but damage to nest hollows occurs when birds are taken for illegal export. In October 2009 an unknown disease killed up to 23 females in a single breeding colony at Koobabbie in the northern wheatbelt (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2011). A heatwave in January 2010 is known to have killed at least 145 birds near Hopetoun and 63 at Munglinup on the south coast, and 57 birds were killed and 24 injured by a hailstorm in the Perth metropolitan area in March 2010 (Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011).<p></p></span>","The total population is estimated to number c.40,000 individuals,&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">based on the expert opinion of the members of the Carnaby’s Cockatoo Recovery Team members. <span lang=""EN-AU"">&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">No detailed survey of the population has been conducted to provide a more accurate figure (P Mawson <em>in litt. </em>2016).</span>",Decreasing,"<em></em><em>Zanda&#160;</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">latirostris</span> is endemic to south-western <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia</span>. Between the 1970s and 1990s, the species disappeared from over one third of its range (Saunders 1990, Saunders and Ingram 1998), with both local extinctions and reduced density in occupied areas, although it has recently been expanding into partially cleared forest habitat along the western fringe of its former range. Its current range covers a large area from the mouth of the Murchison River, north of Geraldton on the mid-north coast east of Esperance on the south coast (Department of Environment and Conservation, Western Australia 2012). Most breeding occurs in the inland parts of its range in areas receiving between 300 and 750mm of annual average rainfall (Saunders 1974a, Department of Environment and Conservation, Western Australia 2012). The total population is estimated at c.40,000 individuals (Department of&#160;&#160;Environment and Conservation, Western Australia 2012), now divided into two subpopulations: one to the north of a line between Perth and Merredin and the other to the south east of Perth (White<em> et al.</em> 2014).

The number of roosts with 151-500 cockatoos reduced by 42% and no roosts had more than 500 birds. The 2016 citizen science Cocky Count revealed an increase in numbers from newly discovered roosting sites (Peck 2016), though analysis of data in the Swan Coastal District between 2010-2014 showed a 14% decline per year due to a combination of reduced occupied roosts and reduced roost size &#160;(Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).

Furthermore, highest densities in unlogged forest were encountered below 180 m, clearly illustrating the importance of primary lowland forest. Another recent study found no significant difference between use of a number of land-use types but found that abundance was positively linked to the presence of strangler figs and suitable large nesting trees (Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>.

Although reported international trade fell to zero in the 1990s, trappers have remained highly active and birds are openly sold within Indonesia (Metz and Nursahid 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. This illegal trade was prolific during religious riots in 2004 (C.

It commutes to adjoining habitats, such as riverine vegetation and agricultural areas, to forage and drink (Warburton and Perrin 2005d)<strong></strong>.

In the dry season it congregates in large flocks of up to 800 or more in some areas (Warburton 1999b)<strong></strong>. It relies on water sources that are not regularly disturbed by humans and livestock (Warburton and Perrin 2005d, T. Dodman<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. It breeds in holes in mature mopane trees near roosting sites<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995b, Warburton and Perrin 2005a)<strong></strong>, during January-May<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(L. S. Warburton <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000, Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. Fidelity to nest-sites is suspected<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. The breeding season coincides with the annual maximum rainfall and the beginning of the dry season<strong></strong>, and pairs usually raise a single clutch (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>. Broods of six and seven nestlings have been observed (Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>. The species roosts in naturally formed cavities in live mopane trees (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005a)<strong></strong>. Food largely consists of annual grass seeds, other seeds of annual herbs and ripening crop seeds (millet and sorghum) (<strong></strong>Dodman 1995c, <strong></strong>Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005b)<strong></strong>. They have also been observed to consume invertebrates, leaves, flowers, nectar, bark, lichen, resin and soil (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005b)<strong></strong>. The crop-ripening season coincides with the species's breeding season<strong> </strong>(Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005d) and its appetite for crop seeds has earned it a reputation locally as a pest<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. In south-west Zambia, it has been recorded that 18% of millet seed heads suffered more than 20% damage from the species during the ripening season (Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. Flocks were observed feeding in sorghum and millet fields in early 2012, mainly east of the Machile River (N. Buys <em>in litt. </em>2012).<p></p>","Three factors are thought to have caused its decline the past century: heavy exploitation for the cage-bird trade from the 1920s<strong></strong> to the 1960s (Moreau 1948, Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>, gradual desiccation of its habitat (Moreau 1948, Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, which is thought to be (currently) the main threat given the highly localised range of the species (Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>, and the partial replacement of sorghum and millet crops, (an attractive food source [Dodman 1995b, L. S. Warburton <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000]<strong></strong>), with maize, between c.1930 and 1950 (Dodman 1995c, Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2000)<strong></strong>. There is evidence that the wild-caught trade in this species is currently at a very low level, with only isolated incidences of trade and export (Dodman 1995c, Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>, although it is clear that any international demand would be met eagerly<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Warburton and Perrin 2005a, d)<strong></strong>. Some birds are caught for subsistence consumption and it is also persecuted as a pest, however these birds would usually be eaten as well (Dodman 1995c, Warburton and Perrin 2005c<strong></strong><strong></strong>)<strong></strong>. Farmers take measures to mitigate damage to crops<strong></strong>, but they are largely ineffective and rarely lethal (Dodman 1995c, Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. The current levels of hunting and capture are unlikely to have any serious long-term impact on the population, but could threaten local populations suffering from the effects of desiccation (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. Recently there may have been local declines due to loss of surface water supplies in the dry season, perhaps due to long-term climate change<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995b, c, Warburton 1999b, Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2000)<strong></strong>. The direct effect of climate change on the species's habitat may not be that great, but the indirect effect through the effect on human populations could have a large impact on the species (Segan <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;The number of permanent water sources in mopane woodland has decreased since the early 20th century<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. The low availability of water in the dry season is probably the principal factor in the disappearance of permanent populations from the Bovu and Sinde Rivers, and changes to the Ngweze River population (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. This is exacerbated by a decrease in the annual rainfall in the species's habitat of, on average, about 5 mm per year between 1950 and 1995, increasing the species's reliance on artificial water sources (Warburton and Perrin 2005d)<strong></strong>. The recent establishment of hand-pumped boreholes along the catchments of the Ngweze, Sichifulo, and Machile rivers may lead to a decrease in the availability of surface water as people reduce their water source creation activities in riverbeds (Warburton and Perrin 2005d)<strong></strong>. In some areas, water pools are poisoned to kill fish and this can impact the species (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. The species may be threatened by the declining dry-season availability of water in temporary rivers in south-western Zambia, due to declining levels of rainfall<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (T. </strong>Dodman<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Mopane woodland is exploited for firewood and timber, with large areas cleared (T. Mzumara <em>in litt. via </em>C. Downs 2016),&#160;though the habitat is regenerating and encroaching into other habitats in some areas (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease Virus is present in the wild population (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>, but there is no evidence that this is a serious threat. <p></p>","The population, based on surveys in 1994, has been estimated at c.10,000 individuals, however due to suspected declines in the population since this year, the population is placed in the range bracket 2,500-9,999 mature individuals.

The rate of population decline is nevertheless suspected to have been rapid over the past three generations, thus it is now listed as Vulnerable. <br/><p></p>","It occurs in várzea and savanna adjacent to tropical forest in east Amazonia, campo cerrado, caatinga and palm-stands in the Gerais, and palm-savannas in the Pantanal. It feeds mostly on the hard fruit of a few regionally endemic palm species (<strong></strong>C. Yamashita <em>in litt</em>. 2000)<strong></strong> (<em>Scheelea phalerata</em> and <em>Acrocomia aculeata</em> in the Pantanal [Antas <em>et al</em>. 2006]<strong></strong>). Nesting is from July-December in large tree-cavities (primarily in <em>Sterculia apetala</em> in the Pantanal [<strong></strong>Johnson 1996<strong></strong>]<strong></strong>, and  <em>S. pruriens </em>in Amazonia [Presti <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009<strong></strong>]<strong></strong>) and on cliffs (in the north-east). Two eggs are usually laid, but only one chick normally fledges (<strong></strong>C. Yamashita <em>in litt</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. The Toco Toucan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ramphastos toco</span> is responsible for dispersing 83% of the seeds of <em>Sterculia apetala</em>, but also consumes 53% of eggs predated (Pizo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><p></p>","There has been massive illegal trade in the species. At least 10,000 birds were taken from the wild in the 1980s, with 50% destined for the Brazilian market (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 1990)<strong></strong>. In 1983-1984, over 2,500 were flown out of Bahía Negra, Paraguay, with an additional 600 in the late 1980s (<strong></strong>J. Pryor <em>in litt</em>. 1998)<strong></strong>. Although these numbers are now much reduced, illegal trade still continues (e.g. 10 passed through a pet market in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, in August 2004-July 2005, where birds were changing hands for US$ 1,000 and were destined for Peru [Herrera and Hennessey 2007]<strong></strong>). More recently it has been noted that there appears to be almost no illegal trade in this species in Bolivia (B. Hennessey <em>in litt</em>. 2012) or Brazil (A. C. Lees <em>in litt</em>. 2015). Across its range, there is some local hunting for food and feathers. In Amazonia, there has been habitat loss for cattle-ranching and hydroelectric power schemes on the rios Tocantins and Xingu. In the Pantanal, only 5% of <em>S. apetala</em> trees have suitable cavities (<strong></strong>Guedes 1993, Johnson 1996)<strong></strong>. Young trees are foraged by cattle and burnt by frequent fires (<strong></strong>Newton 1994)<strong></strong>. The Gerais is being rapidly converted to mechanised agriculture, cattle-ranching and exotic tree plantations (<strong></strong>Conservation International 1999)<strong></strong>.

Throughout the 1980s the species suffered major declines as an estimated 10,000 birds were illegally captured for the pet trade and widespread habitat destruction and hunting caused a further reduction in numbers (Anon. 2004). The majority of the population is now located in the Pantanal, where since 1990 the species has shown signs of a recovery and expanded its range (Pinho and Nogueira 2003, Anon. 2004), probably in response to conservation projects. Populations in east Amazonia and the Gerais have continued to decline, from an estimated 1,500 individuals in 1986 to 1,000 in 2003. The total population was estimated at 6,500 individuals in 2003, of which 5,000 were in the Pantanal (Anon. 2004) and around 200 in Bolivia (M.

Its possible extirpation through hybridisation has been averted owing to three decades of conservation efforts, which have seen the population size increase.

Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Its core breeding areas are located in endemic palm forest dominated by coco de mer <em>Lodoicea maldivica</em>. The species nests in tree cavities mainly in dead coco de mer palms, but they have also been recorded to nest in cavities in other palms and living broadleaf trees (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a), with breeding activity from October to March (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013, Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Deep cavities in hollow <em>L. maldivica</em> trunks with dense canopy cover over the entrance are preferred (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Breeding activity fluctuates widely between years (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;In one sutdy, 53% of nests were found to be successful out of 36 nest attempts with 57% fledgling survival to one year (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). It is also found in cultivated areas and residential areas with gardens, which are suitable feeding habitats (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016). It feeds on a range of plant species, the majority of which are endemic and native (Reuleaux <em>et al. </em>2014b). It mainly feeds on the fruit pulp, followed by seeds and buds, with occasional observations of feeding on leaves, flowers, bark and scale insects (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014b).","The decline in this species prior to the 1960s is thought to have been driven mainly by predation by introduced rats and hunting by settlers and farmers (Rocamora and Laboudallon  2013). Other causes of increased mortality have included capture for pets and trade and incidental trapping when other species are targeted. <br/><br/>The most serious current threats to the species include diseases such as  Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease, ongoing nest predation from rats and cats, competition from introduced bird  species for food and nest-sites, poaching of its main nesting tree (coco de mer), and habitat destruction caused by  fires, with potential threats including persecution, pesticides, netting  of bat species and inbreeding (Rocamora and Laboudallon  2013, Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>. 2014). Forest fires may represent the most serious threat to the species, with records since the early 1980s showing that approximately every 10 years a large fire occurs (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The availability of nesting cavities may be a limiting factor in very active breeding years, with some females occupying sub-optimal cavities. The poaching of coco de mer nuts will likely reduce the area of palm forest over the long term. The presence of Rose-ringed Parakeets <em><span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content"">Psittacula krameri</em> on Mahé, one of which has been recorded on Praslin, increases the risk of disease. The impacts of introduced species through nest predation and competition for nest-sites may not yet be serious enough to limit the population; however, mynahs are increasing on Praslin. Yellow crazy ants do not appear to have impacted the species so far, probably because they do not use dead palm trees, where suitable cavities are located. Predation of fledglings by cats and dogs is probably limited and post-fledging mortality is not currently a major concern. Persecution by farmers is regarded as a minor threat. Other risk factors for the species include its low genetic diversity and large, and so-far unexplained, fluctuations in breeding activity from season to season (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>. 2014).","Point count surveys conducted on Praslin in 2010 and 2011 found a  density of 0.14-0.24 individuals/ha, resulting in a total population  estimate of 520-900 individuals (95% confidence intervals) obtained  through distance sampling methodology (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013).  After reviewing recent survey results, Rocamora and Laboudallon  (2013) estimate a total breeding population of fewer than 200 pairs,  suggesting that there could be fewer than 400 mature individuals. On the basis of these data, it is assumed that there are 340-600 mature individuals in the population.",Stable,"<em>Coracopsis barklyi</em> is resident on Praslin, with occasional records on Curieuse (c.1 km north of Praslin), <strong>Seychelles </strong>(Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013).

No individuals were detected on Curieuse during point counts over four  days and during supplementary fieldwork, thus it is assumed that there  is no resident population there (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). Prior to the surveys by Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. (2013), the most recent  population estimate on Praslin was of 645 individuals (95% confidence  intervals: 404-1,034 individuals), using distance sampling at 39 random  points (Walford 2008). However, this study was deemed to have several  methodological and analytical constraints, which meant that assumptions  of the distance sampling method were not met (Walford 2008, Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013) and resulting in an estimate range that was considered too broad to serve as a basis for conservation planning (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). After reviewing recent survey results, Rocamora and Laboudallon  (2013) estimate a total breeding population of fewer than 200 pairs,  suggesting that there could be fewer than 400 mature individuals. A review of previous survey results indicates that this species&#160;has recovered from a low point of c.30-50 individuals in one area of the island in the late 1960s,  increasing until the at least the turn of the century, with uncertainty  over the trend since then (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013).",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species has been protected by law since 1966 (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013).

Its increasing rarity suggests a dependence on lowland primary forest, although birds do range into scattered fruiting trees in open areas and into secondary and heavily degraded forest.<p></p>","Trapping for the cage-bird trade is a significant problem. Local extinctions as a direct result of forest loss are very likely. In 1988, forest cover was just 3% on Marinduque and 24% on Luzon. Forest cover in the Sierra Madre mountains has declined by 83% since the 1930s. Most remaining areas are under logging concession and may suffer further from major road-building plans. A road development near Subic Bay has increased the incidence of illegal logging and felling is rife at Maria Aurora Memorial Natural Park. Habitat modification may have accentuated interspecific competition, with the species having been replaced by Blue-crowned Racquet-tail <em>P. discurus</em> in Quezon National Park. It appears that the Green Racquet-tail might now only occur in two areas of   Luzon and that Subic Bay might be the only one with any protection (R.   Hutchison <em>in litt. </em>2013).

Commercial logging in the area involves the removal of larger trees and standing dead wood, and appears to reduce nest-site availability by leaving few snags and pine trees large enough for the species to nest in. Such large-scale logging operations across the species's historic range may be responsible for its decline (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. As a result of habitat loss, breeding is now concentrated in two areas; Cebadillas de Yahuirachi and Madera (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

Although it remains common in some areas and the status is clouded by feral/escaped populations, it is suspected to be undergoing a moderately rapid population decline owing to on-going habitat loss, persecution and trapping pressure.","This species inhabits a variety of moist and dry forests and woodlands, as well as cultivated areas, mangroves and plantations, mainly below 900 m, but reaching c.1,600 m locally (Juniper and Parr 1998). In Cambodia, the species inhabits dry deciduous forest and degraded semi-evergreen forest, but also riverine forest, in the lowlands mostly below 300 m (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It feeds on a range of wild and cultivated seeds, flowers, flower buds, nectar, grain, fruit and vegetables (Juniper and Parr 1998). It is considered a serious pest in some areas, with c.70% of its diet in farmed areas of Pakistan attributed to crops. It nests in tree cavities, palms, and very rarely buildings, and generally breeds from November to April, depending on the location (Juniper and Parr 1998).","This species is widely captured and traded as a cage-bird. In Cambodia, targeted nest-robbing and capture of  adults pose the main threats, as it is one of the most sought-after species as a cage-bird (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013) and is used in 'merit releases' (Gilbert <em>et al. </em>2012). Despite the near-disappearance of the species from Thailand, nestlings  still appear in illegal  trade in Bangkok bird markets, although they  possibly originate from Cambodia (P. Round <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Illegal trade, as well as the destruction of nest-sites, threatens the species in Pakistan (S. Khan <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Likewise, it is reported that the species is threatened by extensive poaching by local tribes in Gujarat (V. Vyas <em>in litt</em>.  2013). Habitat loss and degradation are also serious threats. In Cambodia, land-use changes in the lowlands have been rapid (R. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013) and expected rates of degradation and loss of lowland forest are  further expected to impact the species (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Rates of habitat conversion in Laos are described as severe (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2013).","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be of variable abundance across its range.",Decreasing,"<em>Psittacula eupatria</em> is widespread in South and South-East Asia, ranging from <strong>Pakistan</strong>, through most of <strong>India</strong> (including the Andaman Islands and Narcondam Island), <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, much of <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Bhutan</strong> and <strong>Bangladesh</strong> (including Cocos Island), into southern and central <strong>Myanmar</strong>, central <strong>Thailand</strong>, southern and western <strong>Laos</strong>, much of <strong>Cambodia</strong> and southern <strong>Vietnam</strong> (Juniper and Parr 1998). It is noted to show seasonal movements in some parts of its range and nomadism in others. It is described as generally common, but much scarcer in the east of its range, sporadic in southern India and rare in Sri Lanka. Declines are evident in some regions (Juniper and Parr 1998). The species is described as scarce or uncommon in Cambodia (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013, T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2013), having been much reduced, and is now only locally common in the north   and north-east, although never in large flocks (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013).  It has been almost extirpated from north-western and south-western  Cambodia, and the only site known for the species in the south-east,  where it was historically present, may be occupied by a population that  originated from cage-birds. The populations in the north  and north-east  of Cambodia are said to remain healthy and widespread across  near-continuous  habitat (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It is highly localised in Laos, having formerly been present more widely, probably across the country's lowland plain (Thewlis <em>et al. </em>1998, Duckworth <em>et al. </em>1999). It has almost entirely disappeared from Thailand, with the only remaining individuals in small populations, with all known  sites being close   to major human settlements, perhaps implying that  they originate from escaped cage-birds (P.  Round <em>in litt</em>. 2013). The species is common in Jharkhand, India (S. Prakash <em>in litt</em>. 2013) and  appears to be increasing in Gujarat (I. R. Gadhvi <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Recent records in Bangladesh are all from  Dhaka city and presumably relate to  escapes, which are probably breeding there (S. U. Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2013).

Birds have been recorded in breeding condition in June and breeding has been reported between February and August (White and Bruce 1986, Reeve and Rabenak 2016).","Habitat destruction through the combined impacts of firewood  collection, commercial logging, timber extraction for construction  materials, and clearance for agriculture together may represent the most  pertinent threat. The loss and fragmentation of forests is already  extensive on Flores, where no semi-evergreen forest below 1,000 m is  included within gazetted protected areas. These threats are compounded  by human population expansion, with large volumes of timber required for  housing construction, and the fact that there is little or no  governmental enforcement of laws. Moist deciduous forest is currently  being extensively cleared through land grabbing and establishment of  agricultural areas, a factor that is inevitably reducing the range and  population of this species. Forest clearance continues in the coastal  belt to make way for crops, and illegal logging continues in protected  areas.

It is listed as Near Threatened on the basis that it is undergoing a moderately rapid decline owing to habitat loss and trapping pressure.,"This species occurs in the lowlands to c.1,500 m, inhabiting light forest, including savanna, secondary growth, forest edge, clearings and cultivated areas (Juniper and Parr 1998). It is particularly associated with dry deciduous forest throughout south-east Asia (Goes 2013, R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013); although it is occasionally observed in semi-evergreen forest, it seems to be dependent on drier habitat (Goes 2013, W. Duckworth <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is able to persist in partially deforested landscapes and appears to favour forest edge near cultivation (Juniper and Parr 1998). It breeds in January-May, nesting in tree cavities and laying a clutch of usually 4-5 eggs (Juniper and Parr 1998).","This species has suffered much habitat loss (Forshaw 2006), which, in combination with capture for the cage-bird trade and general persecution as pests, have caused  the species to become  uncommon or rare in Thailand (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>.  1997, Juniper and Parr  1998) and Myanmar (Juniper and Parr 1998). International trade records showed that 836 birds were exported between  1981 and 1985, but this increased to 6,873 birds in 1986-1990, primarily from  Vietnam and Thailand (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997). In Laos, habitat encroachment has been so severe in the lowlands  that there are few areas left that are large enough for the species's nests to escape robbery, and there is little active effort to reduce this pressure (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In Cambodia, changes in land-use in the lowlands have been rapid (R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013), and the predicted conversion of dry deciduous forest  for  agro-industrial plantations is expected to cause a  decline of 30% or  more in the national population over the next 20 years (F.

It is listed as Near Threatened because it is suspected to be undergoing a moderately rapid population decline owing to on-going trapping pressure, persecution and habitat loss.","This species uses a variety of forest and  wooded habitats, including human-altered areas, usually below 2,000 m (Juniper and Parr 1998). Habitats utilised by the species include dry forest, moist deciduous secondary forest, mangroves, cultivated areas with trees and human settlements. Its diet includes wild and cultivated fruits, berries, flowers, nectar, nuts and seeds, leaves and cereals such as rice and maize, thus it frequently causes damage to crops. It nests in tree cavities and lays a clutch of 2-4 eggs. Breeding generally takes place from December to April, although almost year-round on Java (Juniper and Parr 1998).&#160;In Nepal, the species is regarded to be easiest parakeet to catch for the pet-trade because of its flocking behaviour and relatively sluggish nature (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral. <em>in litt. </em>2016).","Declines and local extinctions in recent decades have been attributed largely to capture for the live bird trade (Juniper and Parr 1998). Throughout Laos remaining populations are eagerly sought by bird trappers,&#160;and the almost total disappearance from North Laos compared with its wide persistence in the South and Centre (albeit largely at low density and with much local extirpation) reflects the much smaller total area of suitable habitat there and its naturally fragmented layout. Habitat loss through conversion to agriculture is extensive, but large areas of suitable habitat remain with now very low population densities (Fuchs<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007; Duckworth and Timmins 2013, 2015; Timmins 2014; J. W. Duckworth&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Likewise in Bangladesh, the species is targeted for the cage-bird trade and is likely to be impacted by the removal of large trees (P. Thompson&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012). In Nepal a detailed review of species distribution and status for the Nepal bird Red Data Book (Inskipp <em>et al.</em> 2016) found it to be less threatened by trapping for the cage bird trade than previously thought, although it has been recorded in bird markets (Thapa and Thakuri 2009). Outside protected areas it is threatened to some degree in Nepal by habitat loss and degradation (Inskipp <em>et al.</em> 2016). The loss and fragmentation of forest are likely to accelerate  in Cambodia in the near future, given that many large agro-industrial concessions  have been granted recently (H.

The species has increased since the 1990s in Singapore, where it is introduced (D. L. Yong <em>in litt</em>. 2011). It has been described as the commonest Psittacid in some parts of its range, although substantial declines were noted in Thailand and Laos prior to the turn  of the century and local extinctions have occurred (e.g. on Java and  Bali) owing to capture for the live bird trade (Juniper and Parr 1998). The species is described as being on the verge of  extirpation in Hainan province, China, after being recently rediscovered there  (J. Fellowes <em>in litt</em>. 2010). In Nepal, the species is a local resident, frequent in Chitwan National Park and buffer zone and uncommon elsewhere. It has been recorded mainly within the network of protected areas (Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016). It is thought to have been previously widespread in northern Laos, but has disappeared largely from this region of the country; there is also strong evidence of range contraction within the south and centre (Fuchs <em>et al. </em>2007; Duckworth and Timmins 2013, 2015; Timmins 2014, J.

It is listed as Near Threatened because it is suspected to be undergoing a moderately rapid population decline owing to on-going habitat loss and trapping pressure.,"This species frequents oak, teak, cedar and pine forest, open wooded hillsides and cultivated areas with tall trees, at up to 3,800 m (Juniper and Parr 1998). In Cambodia, it may more regularly occur in deciduous hill forest, and in areas with evergreen and semi-evergreen vegetation (S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2013, R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013), and is noted to be patchily distributed in both lowland deciduous forest and degraded hill forest on the Sen Monorom plateau (T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It is noted to use habitats in human-modified open landscapes in some areas (R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013), but in much of southeast Asia it is now restricted to locations close to large areas of remaining intact forest, and this is likely a determinant of successful recruitment throughout the range. In Myanmar, it is described as common in deciduous forest and partly cultivated areas (C. Robson <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It feeds on leaf buds, seeds, fruit and flowers. In central Myanmar, it breeds in January-March (Juniper and Parr 1998).","The species is widely captured for the cage-bird trade and is locally  kept as a pet, for example in Laos and China (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2013, M. Zhang <em>in litt</em>.  2013). In China,  poaching and illegal trade of this species continue:  it is reported that in one village, every  family has one individual of  this species as  a pet, and they carry an asking price of  up to US$80  (M. Zhang <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Trapping pressure may also be contributing to the observed decline in Cambodia (F. Goes<em> in litt</em>. 2013). Lowland forests in  Indochina are under intense pressure, particularly  in Cambodia, owing to  clearance for large-scale industrial agriculture.  This particularly  affects areas with evergreen or semi-evergreen  forest, rather than deciduous forest, owing to better conditions for cultivation (S.  Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2013). This species's apparent reliance on patches of evergreen and semi-evergreen  forest may make it more susceptible to the impacts of logging, particularly because it is likely to rely  on large trees for nesting. In habitats where large trees are scarce, such as hill forest and landscapes with a mixture of deciduous forest, patches of evergreen and semi-evergreen forest are under  particular pressure from logging, even for local use (S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Habitat loss in Cambodia is expected to have a devastating impact on  this species during the next decade, although there may be a lag before  the true effects are observed in the population (H. Rainey <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In Laos, the species's presence in hilly areas may have buffered it from the worst impacts of logging and habitat clearance (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2013).","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be uncommon in China, with variable status elsewhere (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997).",Decreasing,"<em>Psittacula finschii</em> is distributed from eastern <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Bhutan</strong> and <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, through&#160;<strong>Myanmar</strong>, northern and central <strong>Thailand</strong> and <strong>Cambodia</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong>, <strong>Vietnam</strong> and south-western <strong>China</strong> (central Szechuan and northern Yunnan) (Juniper and Parr 1998). The species is rather patchily distributed across this range, with considerable variation in abundance (Juniper and Parr 1998).

Likewise, its range has contracted in northern Laos, where favoured habitats are fragmented and scarce and trapping pressures are extremely high (Timmins and Duckworth 2013); it remains more widespread in South and Central Laos but even there is widely locally extirpated (J.

Legal trade declined through the 1990s and ceased in 2003 <strong></strong>(Poulsen <em>et al. </em>1999); however, illegal trade continues: in 2007 around 2,800 were recorded as poached and in 2008, 60 were recorded in trade in Javan bird markets <strong></strong>(R. Nursahid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">per</span> J. Gilardi <em>in litt. </em>2009). Forests within its range were largely intact at the outset of the 1990s, but exploitation by logging companies for economically valuable timber has become intensive (e.g. Vetter 2009). Important nesting-trees are targeted for extraction because of their large size, and with logging roads greatly facilitating access for trappers, this represents an increasingly significant combination of threats. <p></p>","A population size of 46,000-295,000 individuals was estimated by Lambert (1993a, b) although subsequent work in 1994 suggests the population may at that time have been considerably higher.",Decreasing,"<em>Lorius garrulus</em> is endemic to North Maluku, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, where it is known from Morotai, Rau, Halmahera, Widi, Ternate, Bacan and Obi (BirdLife International 2001).

In 1991-1992, the population was estimated at 46,360-295,540 birds, with trappers potentially removing c.10% annually, a clearly unsustainable rate of harvest. However, in 1994, 52,500 individuals (39,600-69,900) were estimated in only 1,060 km<sup>2</sup> of forest on Halmahera, suggesting a higher population than initially calculated.

This suggests that its population is very small, and likely to be decreasing given that its habitat is shrinking both in extent and quality. For these reasons it is considered Critically Endangered. <p></p> <p></p>","The original series of specimens was collected between 850 and 1,000 m, and comprised individuals found feeding on nectar and pollen, in trees on apparently level land. The birds recorded in November 2014 were found at 1,300 m and were also feeding in flowering trees (Robson 2014). There is one aural record from a coconut plantation in the south, at or near sea-level. Recent observations of a <em>Charmosyna</em> species come from plantations, and selectively logged secondary and primary forest around 600 m. Anecdotal information collected from interviews with local people suggest that it is probably a lower montane species, which in some years occurs down to the coastal lowlands. Further interviews with local inhabitants suggest that the species moves to the lowlands during the two annual hot seasons: in March and April, and between August and November (A. Gray&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. However, confirmation of records from lowlands (e.g. photographs) is still required (C. Robson <em>in litt. </em>2016). It has been seen in pairs but apparently occurs more commonly in groups of up to 10 individuals.<p></p>","The island's extensive montane forests remain largely undisturbed and the topography of the Kaplamandan mountain range means that almost all of the montane forest is expected to be inaccessible to loggers (A. Gray&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. However, having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpubl. data)<strong></strong>. Additionally, while montane forest appears to be relatively undisturbed, most forest in the coastal lowland of Buru has now been cleared, and much of the forest in the northern part of the island has been selectively logged or degraded and fragmented by shifting agriculture, such that only a few small patches of primary lowland forest remain. In 2010, there was at least one fairly large-scale logging operation on Buru, situated in the lowlands (though gardens on the island still contain many indigenous tree species). All the original specimens were caught alive using lime, however the species is not kept as a pet, nor apparently is it traded.<p></p>","Owing to the considerable loss of lowland forest and the paucity of confirmed records this species is suspected to have an extremely small population, probably numbering 50-249 mature individuals. This equates to 75-374 individuals in total, rounded here to 70-400 individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Charmosyna toxopei</em> is endemic to the island of Buru, South Maluku, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, where it was known from seven specimens collected in the 1920s, on the west side of Lake Rana. It was recorded by only one of the 24 collectors active on Buru, implying that it is either very rare, localised, nomadic or has specific habitat preferences. In November 2014 at least two Blue-fronted Lorikeets were observed and photographed on Buru (Robson 2014). Prior to 2014, recent targeted searches yielded no confirmed records of the species (M. Poulsen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), though there have been plenty of unconfirmed and older reports. Observations of an apparent <em>Charmosyna</em> lorikeet on the island, possibly this species, suggest it may be present around Teluk Bara. The species was recorded between 1979 and 1981, with an unconfirmed report in 1989, and interviews with local villagers during the 1990s and 2010 possibly refer to this species; though the interviews in the 1990s revealed that only local people living west of the Rana River knew it, and a survey in May and June 2010 failed to produce any sightings. It should also be noted that local people frequently refer to all green parrots as ""karenga"" and make no differentiation between species (A.

Now that it is extinct in much of its historic range, and some protected populations are increasing, the rate of decline may have slowed or the decline may even have stopped. However, the bulk of the past declines are believed to have occurred within the past three generations and so it is assessed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p> <p></p>","It appears to be restricted to lowland primary and/or secondary forest predominantly below 50 m, in or adjacent to riverine or coastal areas with mangroves. It breeds between January and July, and outside the breeding season it frequents both corn and rice fields. It depends on seasonally fluctuating food resources and is partially nomadic. Birds fly from the mainland to offshore islands as far as 8 km away from the mainland to roost and breed. The species is able to utilise regenerating forest for foraging and, if suitable trees are present, breeding (P.

Lowland deforestation and mangrove destruction have been extensive throughout its range, and have contributed significantly to its decline. It is also persecuted as a crop-pest and hunted for food. Typhoons are a threat, at least in already declining populations.

Recent attempts to establish a large-scale biofuel plantation in  cockatoo habitats on Dumaran, and a coal-fired power plant in the  immediate vicinity of Rasa Island (which held c.280 individuals in 2012), were only prevented by major advocacy campaigns and remain potential threats (P.

It is known from five protected areas: Rasa Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Omoi and Manambaling Cockatoo Reserves in Dumaran, Culasian Managed Resource Protected Area in Rizal and Samar Island Natural Park. Since 1998 an intensive species conservation programme, the Philippine Cockatoo Conservation Program (PCCP) has been implemented by the Katala Foundation. In 2005, the Katala Foundation started to plan and build the Katala Institute for Ecology and Biodiversity Conservation, designed as a centre for environmental education and research, as well as possibly serving a role as a facility for the captive breeding of the species. Three protected areas have been specifically created for the species in Palawan on Rasa Island, Dumaran and Rizal.

Woxvold&#160;<em>per&#160;</em>G. Dutson&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Recorded daily at 600–2,420 m in the YUS conservation area (Freeman <em>et al.</em> 2013). Encounter rates are often similar in logged forest (I. Woxvold&#160;<em>per&#160;</em>G. Dutson&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). It is an extremely specialised frugivore, feeding only on a very few species of fig, and is probably seasonally nomadic. It nests in large, hollow trees, lays one or two eggs (Richards and Whitmore 2015, Pratt and Beehler 2015) and may have a lifespan of 20-40 years (Mack and Wright 1998).&#160;<p></p>","The major threat is hunting for feathers (Coates 1985, Beehler <em>et al.</em> 1986, Mack and Wright 1998), which are used for ornamentation, particularly in ceremonial head-dresses, in much of the Papua New Guinea Highlands and, in some areas, for skins, which are used as bride prices (Schmid 1993). Demand may increase as the population grows, however, the plumes of this species are not worn as commonly as those of other birds (M. Supuma <em>in litt.</em> 2012) and many feathers may be decades old as they tend to be carefully stored when not being used (B. Beehler<em> in litt. </em>2012). In addition, hunting levels potentially have decreased since the introduction of a law preventing the killing of birds with non-traditional means (i.e. shotguns) (G. Dutson <em>in litt. </em>2016). Tourist shows and cultural events have however increased in recent years, which may increase demand for plumes, and birds or feathers are occasionally sold to tourists (van den Bergh 2009) although it is illegal to take them out of the country. Despite demand being generally lower in Papua, birds are also hunted for the cage-bird trade and meat (Nash 1992, K. D. Bishop <em>in litt. </em>1994). Nestlings are captured by felling trees or enlarging nest-cavities, and the scarcity of suitable nest-sites could become a limiting factor. Deforestation is a less major threat to the species since loggers usually leave fig trees (B. Beehler <em>in litt.</em> 2007) and encounter rates for the species are often similar in logged forest (I. Woxvold <em>per </em>G. Dutson <em>in litt.</em> 2016).<p></p>","The only population estimate is based on two pairs inhabiting 14 km<sup>2</sup> at Crater Mountain. Extrapolation suggests a total population of 21,000 pairs (Mack and Wright 1998), which may be placed in the range 20,000-49,999 mature individuals. However, this may have been an overestimate as the Crater Mountain birds sometimes foraged elsewhere, the species is atypically common at this site and is absent from many hunted areas (Mack and Wright 1998). Conversely, it may be an underestimate by not accounting for substantial populations at lower altitudes (B. Beehler <em>in litt.</em> 2000).&#160;<p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Psittrichas fulgidus </em>is patchily distributed across New Guinea (Papua, formerly Irian Jaya, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, and <strong>Papua New Guinea</strong>).

Any nests found may be vulnerable to collectors (Holmes 1990). There are likely to be associated impacts from the fragmentation, poor quality and small area of the remaining habitat, and the small population size (Coxen's Fig-Parrot Recovery Team 2001). The lack of connections between habitat patches may provide a barrier to dispersal; the small population size and the fragmented state of the population and its habitat may make it difficult for birds to find sufficient food, particularly during winter; the lack of habitat may have increased the amount of competition between the fig-parrot and other species of birds; and the small population size (or, more specifically, the lack of social interaction) could inhibit birds from breeding (Coxen's Fig-Parrot Recovery Team 2001, Department of the Environment 2014).</p>","The small range and paucity of recent sightings suggest fewer than 250 mature individuals remain, placed here in the band 50-249 mature individuals (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011).

There is a strong association with <em>Araucaria angustifolia</em> in Rio Grande do Sul and some correlation in the historical distributions of bird and tree, but <em>Amazona vinacea</em> was distributed throughout eastern Paraguay and southern and western Misiones, Argentina, where there has been no <em>Araucaria angustifolia</em> in historic times, and many other food sources are utilised, including seeds of many native and exotic species, even in areas with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Araucaria </span>forest<strong></strong><strong> </strong>(<strong></strong>Lowen <em>et al</em>. 1996, <strong></strong>Juniper and Parr 1998, Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007).

Significant movements may occur in Brazil, possibly dictated by intra- and inter-year variations in <em>Araucaria </em>cone-crop production, but these do not affect the Argentinian or Paraguayan populations. During the breeding season, it is found in pairs or small groups (probably non-reproductive individuals); after the breeding season (February to July), the species congregates in large groups and roosts communally<strong> </strong>(K. Cockle, A. Bodrati, N. Fariña and J. Segovia <em>in litt. </em>2007).  <p></p>","In 1984-1991, 38% of Paraguay's Atlantic forests disappeared<strong></strong> (Huespe Fatecha<em> et al</em>. 1994), and range contractions in Brazil presumably result from similarly extensive deforestation. There is some correlation with the disappearance of <em>Araucaria</em> forest e.g. in Paraná, 73,780 km<sup>2</sup> of <em>Araucaria</em> forest was reduced to 15,932 km<sup>2</sup> in 1965<strong> </strong>(Hueck 1978). Selective logging, colonisation and plantation agriculture threaten remaining forests (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1995). However, in Argentina, <em>Amazona vinacea</em> has disappeared from large forest reserves (e.g. the 1,500 km<sup>2</sup> Iguazú-Urugua-í forest complex), remaining mostly in the mosaic of small farms and degraded forest remnants between San Pedro and Santa Rosa. There, where the wild population numbers approximately 200 individuals, 40 individuals were found in captivity in 35 homes between 2003 and 2005<strong> </strong>(Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. &#160; In 2006 and 2007, from twelve nests identified in this area, only one chick fledged; at least three nests were predated, at least two were flooded during storms, and at three nests the chicks were captured for sale to Brazil<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino Paraná <em>in litt. </em>2007). In the anthropogenic habitat that <em>A. vinacea</em> selects in Argentina, there appear to be few appropriate nest cavities, and most nests are in large, shallow, cavities which are easily predated or flooded during storms<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino Paraná <em>in litt. </em>2007). Furthermore, the species appears to be very conservative in selecting nest sites, returning year after year to cavities that continually fail<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino Paraná <em>in litt. </em>2007). &#160;Interviews in 2015 - 2016 suggested that nest poaching continues to be a problem in Argentina (K. Cockle&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). &#160;Competition with other hole nesting animals may also be important: in the above mentioned nests in Argentina in 2007, <em>A. vinacea</em> apparently lost competitions for nest cavities with exotic honeybees, possums, and several species of hole-nesting birds, apparently during the incubation stage<strong> </strong>(Proyecto Selva de Pino Paraná <em>in litt. </em>2007). Internal trade has probably affected Brazilian and Argentine populations, and one massive bird-smuggling operation was centred in Paraguay and included <em>A. vinacea</em> (Endangered Species Bull. 1995 20[2]:7). The species was also shot as a crop pest in certain areas<strong> </strong>(White 1882<strong>, </strong>Chebez 1992), but this does not appear to be an important threat today (Cockle <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><p></p>","Based on estimates of 1,500-2,000 individuals in Brazil (G.

Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Work involving radio-tagged individuals has shown that the species may also make use of farming and ranching areas (Salinas-Melgoza <em>et al. </em>2013), and land management type can influence home range size and roosting behaviour (Salinas-Melgoza <em>et al. </em>2013). This may be a result of differences in resource availability (Salinas-Melgoza <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Yellow-naped Amazons have been reported to use traditional sites for roosting for decades (Wright 1996), though data from radio-tagged individuals indicate that traditional roosts may change location (A. Salinas-Melgoza and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016). Roost size can be up to several hundred individuals (Matzuak and Brightsmith 2007), though in some areas roost size does appear to have reduced significantly (M. Lezama <em>per </em>C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016). The species may perform regional movements of up to 16 km (A. Salinas-Melgoza and T. Wright <em>in litt.</em> 2016); and&#160;genetic evaluations indicate there are high rates of gene flow through Costa Rica with ongoing dispersal, probably female-biased (Wright <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;The species's diet has been seldom studied,&#160;but so far it has been found to feed on 48 food plant species (Matuzak <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008,&#160;A. Salinas-Melgoza and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016).","The species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation, driven primarily by the expansion of agriculture, and capture for local and international trade (Juniper and Parr 1998, Anon. 2008). Deforestation has been a prevalent threat in all range states (Grijalva 2008). For example, mangrove forests in the Gulf of Fonseca region are being cleared for the development of aquaculture and extraction of firewood and timber (Grijalva 2008). In Honduras, the species has been recorded as being c.93% less common in modified habitats, such as cultivation, compared to broadleaved forest (Wiedenfeld 1993). The conversion of areas to sugar cane or rice production is also threatening its habitat, particularly in Nicaragua (C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;It is considered one of the most sought-after psittacines in the Central American pet trade<em></em>, owing to the species’s vocal capabilities (Wiedenfeld 1993, R. Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011 J. Gilardi <em>in litt</em>. 2011). During the 1990s, close to 100% of known nests in southern Guatemala were subject to poaching, and significant areas of habitat have been lost to the expansion of sugarcane cultivation (L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2011). In south-western El Salvador, the species also suffers heavy nest-poaching, as well as cavity occupation by Africanised Bees (R. Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011). It has been reported that each year c.5,000 young <em>A. auropalliata</em> are smuggled out of La Mosquitia region, Honduras (<em>per</em> O. Andino <em>in litt</em>. 2011), although this has not been verified. Such numbers would not be unrealistic given that, on average, 8,388 birds were recorded in export from Honduras each year in the period 1987-1989 (Wiedenfeld 1993). The numbers of this species that are recorded in export from Nicaragua appear to be decreasing (Lezama <em>et al</em>. 2004); however, nest poaching is still high (J. A. Díaz Luque <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2011), and thought to affect over 50% of nests in Rivas department (M. Lezama <em>in litt</em>. 2011). In Costa Rica, roughly a third of nests were raided in one study, accounting for c.85% of the all nest failures observed (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2001, Grijalva 2008), although in one study conducted near Liberia, up to 100% of the nests located by researchers at study sites had been poached (A. Salinas <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Further study in Liberia has suggested that 64% of nests may be poached (C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>per </em>A. Salinas-Melgoza <em>in litt. </em>2016). Poaching of nestlings can also affect future breeding in the species, as damage of nest trees when extracting nestlings can make the tree no longer usable as a nest site (C. Dahlin<em>&#160;per </em>A. Salinas-Melgoza <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is thought that twice as many are taken from the wild than are recorded in export, based on a mortality rate of 54% during capture and transit (Pérez and Zúñiga 1998 in Grijalva 2008), although a survival rate of one in three or four has also been reported (<em>per</em> O. Andino <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Anthropogenic threats are thought to exacerbate the effects of poor rates of recruitment to the breeding population (Grijalva 2008). Climate change may also have an impact on the species as there have been hotter and longer dry seasons in the region, though the impact of this on the species is essentially currently unknown (C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016).","Partners in Flight estimated the population to number fewer than 50,000 individuals (A. Panjabi <em>in litt.</em> 2008), thus it is placed in the band 20,000-49,999 individuals here; although it has been suggested that the global population size may be &lt;10,000 mature individuals (J.

The total population has been estimated at fewer than 50,000 individuals (A. Panjabi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2008), although it may actually number fewer than 10,000 individuals (J.

Salinas <em>in litt. </em>2016). The species is thought to be in rapid decline, probably throughout most of its range, owing to the loss and degradation of its habitats and unsustainable exploitation for trade. An estimated overall population decline of c.50% from c.1980 to 2000 has been   reported (Anon. 2008), although this requires confirmation. Preliminary surveys and observations suggest that the population in southern Guatemala has plummeted since the 1990s (L. Joyner <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Interviews with local elders in south-western El Salvador provide anecdotal evidence that the species has undergone a significant decline since the 1950s and 1960s (R. Bjork <em>in litt</em>. 2011). In the early 1990s, the population in Gracias a Dios, Honduras, was estimated at c.123,000 birds; however, by this time the species had been nearly extirpated from Choluteca and El Valle (Wiedenfeld 1993). Surveys in Nicaragua indicate a steep decline in the species’s abundance between 1994-1995 and 2004 (Lezama <em>et al</em>. 2004), and locals in some areas report that the species has disappeared from the vicinity of human settlements (Grijalva 2008). There has been some suggestion that the introduction of a ban in trade of the species in Nicaragua may have slowed or halted declines (A. Salinas-Melgoza <em>in litt. </em>2016), though some sites that had previously held large numbers may now hold very few (M. Lezama <em>per </em>C. Dahlin and T. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2016). The population in Costa Rica also appears to be in decline (T. Wright <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Although the Costa Rican population is regarded as one of the most secure, local people report that the species has declined since the 1970s and 1980s (A. Salinas <em>in litt</em>. 2011), with formal counts at 6 sites in Costa Rica having noted a decline of 48.9% between 2005 and 2016 (C. Dahlin and T.

In Rio de Janeiro, many important habitat fragments are being cleared, notably around Desengano State Park. The collapse of the cocoa economy in south Bahia has resulted in increased logging by landowners and the colonisation of reserves by former plantation workers (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000). If the seasonal displacement of birds is confirmed, this would multiply the problems of habitat loss. In the 1998-1999 breeding season, 174 nestlings were poached, mostly from reserves, for the national and international cage-bird trade<strong> </strong>(Brown and Brown 1992), while 664 individuals were recorded in captivity at the Centre for Reintroduction of Wild Animals in 2005-2006 and others were found in private cages<strong> </strong>(L.

Although primarily resident, the species undertakes three different types of excursion into lower areas: daily flights,  short visits with overnight stops, and more extensive periodic  wanderings, all largely prompted by the availability of <em>Podocarpus</em> fruits (Collar and Boesman 2017).","Human impacts on indigenous forests, most of which have little visible protection, may affect nest site and food availability. There is a long history of logging by settlers, with selective logging taking place more recently and continued illegal logging in some areas (Downs 2015). Removal of adults from the wild for illegal trade is a potential threat; the number of birds involved is uncertain but it does not currently appear to be having a population-level impact. There is a potential risk that recognition as a species, and CITES listing, could increase international demand for trade in the species in the future (Collar and Fishpool 2017). An increasing prevalence of Psittacine Beak-and-feather disease has been predicted, but the likely impact is uncertain (Downs 2015).

The introduced Rainbow Lorikeet&#160;<em>Trichoglossus</em>&#160;<em>haematodus </em>may pose a threat through competition (although it has different habitat and dietary requirements so competition is unlikely), or through transmission of Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) (Jackson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).","The population is estimated to number&#160;1,780 mature individuals in total (Theuerkauf<em> in litt. </em>2016), rounded here to 1,800 mature individuals.",Increasing,"<em>Eunymphicus uvaeensis</em> is restricted to Ouvea, <strong>New Caledonia (to France)</strong>, where most birds occur in c.20 km<sup>2</sup> of forest in the north, although c.60 km<sup>2</sup> of habitat remains (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>.

Its foraging habitat includes all types of native forest, sub-alpine scrub, tussock and herb-field. It mostly feeds on berries and shoots, although many have adapted to feeding at refuse dumps and ski-fields. It nests in holes, under logs or in rocky crevasses, mainly within forest. It usually incubates up to four eggs. Males feed the females during incubation and after hatching. Birds breed after three or more years.

Orr-Walker <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","Up until its partial protection in the early 1970s, over 150,000 were shot in a bounty scheme, established because rogue individuals were found to be attacking sheep as a source of fat.

Introduced mammalian predators such as stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em>, cats and brush-tailed possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em> have spread into most of the species's range. Episodic, high mortality events are thought to be associated with “plagues” of stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em> which occur after mast seeding of native beech and rimu (Kemp 2013). Monitoring by the Department of Conservation between 2009-2014 found that only 2% of kea nests in areas without pest control were successful, in contrast with a 27% success rate&#160;in areas treated with aerial 1080 in 2015 (Department of Conservation 2016). It is estimated that around 60% of kea nests are normally attacked by predators, especially stoats, which may also kill adults; this can rise to as many as 99% of nests being attacked in a stoat “plague” (Department of Conservation 2016). Birds are sometimes killed through accidents with human objects (e.g. motor vehicles, snow groomers, rubbish bins, electricity sub-stations) (Orr-Walker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).

Reducing supplementary feeding levels has been shown to increase the percentage of female chicks produced and may assist in redressing the skewed gender balance (Clout&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, Robertson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>.&#160;A research programme is under way to assess whether low levels of vitamin D found in kakapo are natural, or as a result of management (von Hurst <em>et al. </em>2016) and an analysis of vitamin D levels in kakapo in Whenua Hou found higher levels in birds that had received supplementary food (Chatterton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Research is also underway into the link between mast fruiting events and kakapo fertility (Stone&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017,&#160;Davis&#160;<em>ei al.</em>&#160;2018).<br/>During breeding seasons, each nest is monitored using infra-red video cameras and remote proximity sensors.

At least in West Africa, the species makes seasonal movements out of the driest parts of the range in the dry season. It is highly gregarious, forming large roosts at least historically containing up to 10,000 individuals (Juniper and Parr 1998). Feeding takes place in smaller groups of up to 30 birds and the diet consists of a variety of fruits and seeds, while the nest is in a tree cavity 10-30 m above ground  (Juniper and Parr 1998). Nesting is usually solitary, but can take place in loose colonies, for example in Principe, while the breeding season varies across the range  (Juniper and Parr 1998).<p></p>","It is one of the most popular avian pets in Europe, the United States,  and the Middle East due to its longevity and unparalleled ability to  mimic human speech and other sounds. Demand for wild birds is also  increasing in China, and increased presence of Chinese businesses in  central Africa (particularly for mining, oil and logging) may increase  illegal exports of this species (<strong></strong>F. Maisels <em>in litt.</em> 2006, H. Rainey <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. From 1982 to 2001, over 1.3 million wild-caught individuals of both <span style=""font-style: italic;"">erithacus </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">timneh</span> (the vast majority <span style=""font-style: italic;"">erithacus</span>) entered international trade (UNEP-WCMC 2016), and considering the pre-trade mortality can be 30-66% (Fotso 1998a, b, McGowan 2001, Hart 2013), the number collected could far exceed this figure (Martin <em>et al. </em>2014,&#160;R. Martin <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). During 1984 – 1992, more than 50,000 individual wild birds were traded annually (UNEP-WCMC 2016). In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cameroon exported an annual quota of 10,000 birds; estimates that c.90% of trapped birds died before reaching Douala airport suggest that some 100,000 birds per year were being captured in Cameroon during that period (F. Dowsett-Lemaire <em>in litt. </em>2012).  Official statistics give exports of 367,166 individuals from Cameroon in the period 1981-2005, and the country accounted for 48% of exports between 1990-1996 (Waugh 2010).&#160;Up to 10,000 wild-caught birds from the Democratic Republic of the Congo  are apparently imported into South Africa each year (S. Boyes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2011).&#160;There has been a reduction in the trade of this species, partly due to extra trade restrictions, but also due to population declines, which leads collectors to move onto populations previously not harvested (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). The majority of legal exports are now from central Africa, and difficulties regulating trade mean that quotas have been regularly exceeded (CITES 2016). In addition, illegal international trafficking occurs but levels are difficult to quantify (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/>Because the species concentrates in traditional nesting, roosting, drinking and mineral lick sites, it is especially vulnerable to trapping pressure. Habitat loss is undoubtedly having significant impacts, particularly throughout West and East Africa. In addition to capture for international trade, there is an active internal trade in live birds for pets and exhibition (McGowan 2001, Clemmons 2003, A. Michels <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). The species is also hunted in parts of the range as bushmeat and to supply heads, legs and tail feathers for use as medicine or in black magic (Fotso 1998a, McGowan 2001, Clemmons 2003, A. Michels <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012).  <br/>Forest loss is also negatively impacting populations, and is considered to have contributed to declines in Ghana and may be a larger threat than the pet trade in Cameroon (Tamungang and Cheke 2012, Annorbah <em>et al.</em> 2016). The loss of large trees with nesting cavities may be particularly detrimental. Although some observers have noted populations are associated with primary forest (D<span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content"">ändliker 1992, Juste 1996, <span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content""><span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content"">Clemmons 2003), permanent populations in semi-urban areas, and its frequent use of farm-bush, plantations and secondary forest suggest this species may be robust to some habitat change (Tamungang and Cheke 2012, R.

In 1994, the <em>P. e. princeps</em> CITES listing was removed due to lack of evidence that it is a valid subspecies. Due to concern about the effects of the large numbers of this species traded, it was the subject of a CITES significant trade review, in which it was listed as of ""possible concern"" (Inskipp <em>et al.</em> 1988)<strong></strong>. The Animals Committee of CITES recommended a two-year ban from January 2007 in Cameroon. There have been multiple CITES Reviews of Significant Trade of this species, and together with additional trade restrictions this has resulted in reductions in international trade of this species (R. Martin <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016) and the species has now been moved to CITES Appendix I (S. Chng <em>in litt. </em>2016). Only Cameroon has a published export quota (currently 3000 per annum) (R.

The species is consequently listed as Least Concern. If it is demonstrated that the loss of dead trees is likely to cause significant future declines in the global population, the status of this and other nest hollow-dependent species would warrant reconsideration.<br/>  <p></p>","It nests in the New South Wales and Victorian Riverina in loose colonies in riparian woodland of river red gum <em>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</em> and forages in box woodland. On the slopes of the Great Dividing Range, it forages and nests in box-gum woodland, preferring highly modified, open habitat such as scattered paddock trees on private agricultural land (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2004, <em></em>2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Nesting birds on the South-West Slopes show clear preferences for Blakely's red gum trees <em>E. blakelyi</em>, dead and aging trees in general, and larger trees, as all of these factors are correlated with the presence of suitable nest hollows (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species also shows a preference for lower elevations in this area, which are dominated by agriculture (Manning <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, in contrast to the poorer soils and lower temperatures of higher elevations (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the Riverina, it feeds on the seeds of herbaceous plants, switching to lerp, mistletoe berries, eucalypt flowers and grass seed in winter, and forages up to 15 km from the nest. In contrast, it appears that the most important habitats for breeding birds on the South-West Slopes are within 3 km of nest-sites (Manning <em>et al. </em>2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","Range contraction is largely the result of clearing for agriculture. Decreases in the species's abundance are linked to land clearing that does not leave scattered trees in the landscape (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Remaining habitat is often fragmented, with feeding and breeding habitats divided. Regeneration is commonly prevented by high grazing levels by stock and rabbits or inappropriate fire regimes. Scattered box-gum woodland is threatened by limited regeneration, rural tree dieback, removal of trees and firewood collection (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In breeding areas the majority of nest trees are often on private land, with scattered paddock trees in mixed agricultural land of vital importance on the South-West Slopes. Nest-site fidelity means that birds continue to use traditional breeding sites despite habitat loss and degradation (Leslie 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Many nest trees are dead, particularly on inland slopes, and have no replacements when they fall or are cut for firewood, potentially resulting in competition with other species, particularly the Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>. There are limited provisions for the protection of dead trees, and due to continued illegal removal and natural loss of old trees a decline in nest site availability is inevitable (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In areas of low occupancy, the availability of food in the breeding season, and not that of nest hollows, may limit population size (Leslie 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the Riverina, altered flooding regimes may compromise the health and extent of riparian woodlands where this species nests (C. Tzaros and M. A. Weston <em>in litt. </em>2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Illegal trapping occurs, but is a far less significant threat than habitat loss. Birds are also killed on roadsides and possibly suffer from pesticide poisoning. The abundance and distribution of the species appears to be affected by changes in plant productivity, as influenced by climate (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is therefore susceptible to climate change and its interaction with fragmentation (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">An expert review panel considered it highly likely that the population in 2010 exceeded 10,000 mature individuals, probably by many thousands (Garnett <em>et al. </em>2011). A study systematically sampling 23,000 km<sup>2</sup> of parrot habitat on the western slopes in 2001 (Manning <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007) found nearly 1,500 parrots in 53 out of 81 well-separated sites. Furthermore they were reported from throughout the landscape, not just where there were corridors of trees as had previously been thought essential for the species. A simple extrapolation of these results gives a total population of over 400,000 individuals. While no member of the Australian Threatened Species Committee thought this number likely, they thought it highly unlikely the total could be as low as 10,000. The total is thus placed here in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals but may prove to be higher.  </p>",Increasing,"<em>Polytelis swainsonii</em> is endemic to Victoria and New South Wales, <strong>Australia</strong>. It has undergone a substantial historical range contraction, and bioclimatic modelling of suitable climatic conditions within its range supports this and suggests that it now occupies a relatively small part of its former range (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. In Victoria, it is now largely confined to the Nathalia area, especially Barmah State Forest, birds having disappeared from central and southern areas in the early 1900s, and it has substantially declined in northern Victoria by 1930. In New South Wales, it has declined in the Parkes district since the 1960s. However, its range may have extended to Deniliquin and in northern New South Wales over the same period, and apparent increases have been noted in Canberra. The breeding population was estimated at fewer than 5,000 pairs in the early 1990s and, owing to a likely decline, was thought to number c.6,500 mature individuals in 2000. <span lang=""EN-AU"">A study systematically sampling 23,000 km<sup>2</sup> of parrot habitat on the western slopes in 2001 (Manning <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2007) found nearly 1,500 parrots in 53 out of 81 well-separated sites.  Furthermore they were reported from throughout the landscape, not just  where there were corridors of trees as had previously been thought  essential for the species.

However, there are some signs of recovery now.<p></p> <p></p>","It utilises forest islands and gallery forest found fragmented throughout the Beni Savannas at an 80:20 ratio. Motacú palm <em>Attalea phalerata</em> is a principal food of all macaws in the area, with abundances ranging from 0-100% in forest islands in the savannas, and borders of gallery forest. It nests in cavities, hatching 1-3 eggs. Birds living in the north of the&#160;Llanos de Mojos breed around the end of the dry season (September and October) whilst birds in the south breed at the beginning of the wet season (November onwards) (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Preferred nesting cavities typically have a diameter of 30 cm or more and are found in trees with a diameter at breast height of 60 cm or more (Gould 2013a). The species is most frequently found in pairs, but small groups (7-9) do occur and one large roosting group of 70 is known, thought to be made up of non-breeding birds (I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012, J. Gilardi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). <br/><p></p>","It was severely threatened in the past by legal and illegal exploitation for the national and international cage-bird trade (A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1999, I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), although this has been radically reduced since 1984 (I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). However in 2010 illegal trading of two recently-poached wild juvenile Blue-throated Macaws was uncovered&#160;(Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). The juveniles were eventually released into the wild, however this demonstrates that illegal poaching does still occur. All known breeding sites are on private cattle-ranches, where burning and clearing for pasture and tree-felling for fuel and fence posts have reduced the number of suitable nest trees and inhibited palm regeneration<strong> </strong>(Duffield and Hesse 1997, Hesse 1998, J. Gilardi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. However, cattle-rearing has occurred in the region since the 17th century (A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1999); thus, the preferred food, the motacú palm <em>Attalea phalerata</em>, has been substantially reduced and is only regenerating slowly (B. Hennessey <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Nest-site competition from other macaws, toucans, bats and large woodpeckers is significant, and disturbance from mammals, birds and human activity may reduce the reproductive output of some pairs (J. Gilardi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Between 2007 and 2012, 30 nests were monitored. Of these nests, 57% failed, with most failures occurring during incubation (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014). Reasons for nest failure were diverse but included disease, predation and abandonment. Botfly (<em>Philornis</em> spp.) infestations have been responsible for nest failures as have bees colonising nest sites, extreme weather events and parental neglect (Gould 2013a). Nestlings are vulnerable to predation from: Toco Toucan <em>Ramphastos toco</em>, Crane Hawk <em>Geranospiza caerulescens</em>, Great-horned Owl <em>Bubo virginianus&#160;</em>and Southern-crested Caracara <em>Caracara plancus</em> (Gould 2013a). Hunting to provide feathers for indigenous headdresses probably has an important impact in some areas (I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). <br/><br/>There are fears that inbreeding within an increasingly fragmented population is resulting in reduced fertility<strong></strong> (Loro Parque Fundación 2003). This is compounded by a lack of recruitment to the breeding population; during a five year study, no new breeding pairs were recruited (Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Disease also represents a significant threat, particularly in areas where the species shares water sources with other bird species (Gould 2013a). A Population Viability Analysis found that changes in adult mortality had the greatest impact on estimates of extinction probability and population growth rates and that habitat loss and poaching also affected these estimates (Strem and Bouzat 2012).<p></p>",In 2007 the population was estimated at 250-300 individuals including 70 birds discovered at a dry season roost site&#160;(Waugh 2007). Given the uncertainty over the number of mature individuals this is placed in the band 50-249 until better data are available.,Stable,"<em>Ara glaucogularis</em> is known from the Llanos de Mojos in north <strong>Bolivia</strong>. There are two subpopulations: the northern subpopulation is found from  west of Santa Ana eastwards across the upper río Mamoré, Beni, where the wild population was discovered in 1992<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Duffield and Hesse 1997,&#160;Yamashita and Barros 1997), to the eastern  savannas; the southern subpopulation is found mostly in the Maraban  province in Beni, close to the town of Loreto. In 2007, the total population was estimated to number 250-300 individuals occupying a range of c.4,000 km<sup>2</sup>, with 70 individuals discovered at a dry season roost site that year<strong> </strong>(Waugh 2007). An estimated 1,200 or more wild-caught birds were exported from Bolivia during the 1980s, suggesting that the population was formerly much higher (Yamashita and Barros 1997).<br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. Officially considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Bolivia (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Agua 2009). Asociación Armonía/Loro Parque Fundación produced a Blue-throated Macaw Recovery Plan in 2003. It was listed as endangered under the U.S.A. Endangered Species Act in November 2013 (Gould 2013b). Live export from Bolivia was banned in 1984, although illegal export was still evident in 1997 (Duffield and Hesse 1997). The Asociación Armonía/Loro Parque Fundación parrot trade monitoring project has recorded reduced levels of trade in the species<strong> </strong>(B. Hennessey <em>in litt. </em>2008), but the large scale illegal trade infrastructure in Bolivia means there is the potential to start trapping again if there is the demand. Agreement has been reached with some landowners to control access and deter potential trappers, and negotiations with other landowners continue<strong> </strong>(Hesse 1998, A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999). Based on field surveys, recommendations have been made that the Paraparau region, Beni department, be given greater conservation priority (Tobias 2003). <br/><br/>Much of the remaining population occurs on private ranch-lands. Many landowners are sympathetic to conservation work on their lands and continued support will benefit the species's recovery. Local conservation work has involved planting trees that provide food for the species (Gould 2013a) and a&#160;nest box campaign which has been run since 2004 and has found that there is a great demand for suitable nesting cavities. The active management and monitoring of nest box use has helped to reduce the incidence of nest failure (Berkunsky 2010). A recent study found that birds more readily used nest boxes that were placed in the same tree, or very near to a nest site used in previous years (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014). <br/><br/>Asociación Armonía, with the help of the American Bird Conservancy and World Land Trust, completed the purchase of a 3,555 ha private reserve protecting at least 20 Blue-throated Macaw in November 2008<strong>&#160;</strong>(BirdLife International 2008). The Barba Azul Nature Reserve protects important foraging and roosting sites for over 100 Blue-throated Macaw individuals from March to early November (Asociación Armonia <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). With additional land purchases, the Barba Azul Nature Reserve was expanded to 5,000 ha (Anon. 2012) and in 2014 was expanded to almost 11,000 ha (Anon. 2014b). The reserve will be used for education, research and tourism and, with the support of Bird Endowment, an additional 100 nest boxes were due to be put in place for the 2008/2009 breeding season<strong>&#160;</strong>(B. Hennessey&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2008). In 2017, another 80 nest boxes were added (Asociación Armonia 2018). The Loreto population fledged 71 chicks under the Armonia / Loro Parque Fundacion nest box program since 2006 (Asociación Armonia 2018). The World Land Trust also carries out nest-box provision, as well as the feeding of nestlings and other manipulations. Nest guarding and monitoring has also been introduced at nests that are particularly vulnerable to predation (Gould 2013a). Other measures include on-going surveys of potential areas where populations may persist; a pet trade monitoring programme in two main Bolivian cities, land acquisition programmes conducted in order to protect key habitat and populations, as well as reforestation programmes for the Motacú palm. There has been a widespread education programme, including pamphlets, posters, T-shirts, presentations, short-wave radio spots, video programmes, TV interviews, travel to the most remote ranches giving presentations on laptops, and creation of interpretation centres in the bottle-neck towns of Trinidad, Santa Rosa and Santa Ana. Artificial feathers have been successfully produced and marketed to local people to replace authentic Blue-throated Macaw feathers used in traditional headdresses (Anon. 2014a). <br/><br/>The population in captivity (some of which is held in captive-breeding facilities) is many times larger than the wild population.&#160;In 2009 a formal agreement was signed between the Loro Parque Fundación, Asociación Armonía, the Zoo Fauna Sudamericana and the Noel Kempff Mercado Natural History Museum which formalises the initiation of a managed cooperative breeding programme in Bolivia (Anon. 2008). Modelling the effect of different management strategies on the population dynamics showed that the reintroduction of 50 adult individuals would double the wild population within 10 years (Maestri <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue nest guarding and monitoring. Expand, monitor and improve nest boxes and the captive-breeding programme. Develop a reintroduction programme. Continue illegal pet trade monitoring and confiscations of all native parrots from traders. Lobby local and national government regarding illegal pet trade. Research and promote the acquisition of land for the species's long-term conservation, studies into habitat requirements and restoration, and sustainable tourism support. Conduct research on Motacú palm to understand how to manage and regenerate the habitat (Gould 2013a). Continue wide-ranging education programmes, especially in Santa Rosa and Santa Ana area - supported by interpretive centres. Promote alternatives to macaw feather head-dress usage. Develop tourism infrastructure on private reserve lands. Maintain a low level of population monitoring and occasional new surveys. Implement field research to identify principal health threats. Further research needed into post-breeding behaviour; a study from 2007 to 2012 suggested that successful pairs do not breed the following year and more work is needed to ascertain how common this behaviour is (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014). A monitoring project is planned to track movements during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. It is not possible to follow flocks during the non-breeding season due to flooding, so tracking work will provide important information on the species's movements during this period (Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).<p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Overall, the availability and flowering of the feed trees can severely affect the availability of breeding habitat (Tzaros <em>et al</em>. 2009). Most breeding birds are found in remnant forest patches of less than 0.01 km<sup>2</sup>. They nest in hollows of both live and dead eucalypt trees (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2007). The most common tree species used for nesting are stringybark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. obliqua</span>, white peppermint <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. pulchella </span>and Tasmanian blue gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span>, white gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. viminalis</span>, gum-topped stringybark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. delegatensis</span> and dead stags (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Several pairs often nest in close proximity, in the same or neighbouring trees<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>. On the mainland, it occurs in eucalypt forest and woodlands, mainly box-ironbark habitats on the inland slopes of the Great Dividing Range and in coastal forests. Critical food resources occur within this habitat, principally nectar from prolific flowering species such as red ironbark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. tricarpa</span>, grey box <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. microcarpa</span>, yellow gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. leucoxylon</span> and mugga ironbark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. sideroxylon </span>on the western slopes, and Swamp Mahogany<span style=""font-style: italic;""> E. robusta</span> and spotted gum<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Corymbia maculata</span> in coastal areas.<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>Lerp (sugary secretions from sap sucking insects on leaves; D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2007) is also a favoured food source and is occasionally preffered over blossom, even when abundant blossom is available where birds are present (M. Roderick, D. Ingwersen pers. obs.). During the winter the birds are semi-nomadic and visit a network of traditional sites in reaction to flowering events and lerp availability (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005). Their wintering distribution varies greatly between years, depending on climatic conditions and the resulting food availability (Saunders and Heinsohn 2008). However it will also repeatedly use the same sites between years and often remain in winter foraging habitats for extended periods within a season (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). In some years, urban landscapes containing indigenous or non-local flowering eucalypts are also readily used (C. Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2003). The importance of larger trees as a food source has been shown in this species's breeding range (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004) and wintering range (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005), as such trees tend to offer a more reliable and abundant source of nectar. Individuals can travel up to 5,000 kilometres between their mainland wintering grounds and their Tasmanian breeding sites, making theirs the longest migration undertaken by any parrot in the world (Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><p></p>","Nest predation by Sugar Gliders&#160;<em>Petaurus breviceps</em> introduced to Tasmania&#160;poses a severe threat (Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and is estimated to cause severe declines over the next three generations (Heinsohn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Surveys revealed that&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;predated nests and the probability of a nest surviving the 60-day nesting period when&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;were present was 0.17&#160;(Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). On mainland Tasmania almost 79% nests were predated and 65% of adult females were killed by Sugar Gliders. Predation was most severe in locations with low forest cover. Owing to the fact that Swift Parrot breeding distribution varies widely between years the extent of nest predation is also expected to vary annually depending on the distribution of&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;and forest cover. Sugar Gliders have not been reported from Bruny Island, a Swift Parrot breeding site.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and alteration within breeding and drought refuge habitats remains a key threat. In Tasmania, breeding habitat is significantly reduced and fragmented through clearance of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span> for agriculture, residential development, plantation timber, sawlog production and clear-felling for woodchips. In 2017, a large area of key nesting habitat has been logged for timber extraction (D. Stojanovic <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Over 50% of the original grassy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span> forest in Tasmania has been cleared (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). Selective logging has resulted in the removal of larger trees from the remaining forest patches. Such patches are typically unfenced and exhibit poor regeneration (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). Competition for remaining nest-sites with Common Starlings <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sturnus vulgaris</span> could be a problem along forest edges. Even with protection of remaining habitat (80% private land), maintenance and recovery may be limited by the dependence of breeding on an irregular nectar supply. It also suffers high mortality through collision with windows, vehicles and fences. On the mainland, clearance and degradation of habitat for agriculture, forestry and residential and commercial development has had the biggest impact (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2007). Much of the preferred lowland habitat on the most fertile and productive sites has been cleared or substantially modified (C. Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2003). Drought refuge habitats continue to be cleared and fragmented for coastal developments (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Remnants, including much of what currently exists in the conservation reserve system, have been heavily cut-over and degraded, and this practice is continuing in many areas, including hardwood production forests. This practice is considered to result in poor and unreliable nectar-sources through the reduction of large mature trees. Competition from large nectarivores honeyeaters and the introduced Bumblebee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bombus terrestris </span>may be exacerbated by forest fragmentation. In winter, the species relies heavily on public land that has been exploited for timber, honey and minerals (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Global warming threatens to alter habitat phenology and climatic conditions such that habitat availability may be significantly reduced (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;in litt.</span>&#160;2007). The species is also threatened by disturbance, Psittacine beak and feather disease and illegal bird capture and trade (D. Saunders&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Furthermore, the species seems to be very susceptible to Allee effects, where survival and reproductive success decline with decreasing population density, which might even accelerate the population decline (Crates <em>et al</em>. 2017).","Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2011) estimate that the current population probably contains around 2,000 mature individuals and is declining. It is placed in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;breeds in Tasmania, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia</span>, mostly along the south-eastern coast from St Helen's to Southport with a small breeding population in the north near Deloraine. After breeding, birds disperse throughout Tasmania before migrating north to mainland Australia. In most years, a large portion of the population winters in central Victoria, with a smaller number of birds wintering further afield (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2007). However during periods of extreme drought in central Victoria, Swift Parrots undertake large-scale movements (up to 1,000 km) to drought refuge habitats in wetter coastal areas of New South Wales (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Small flocks are recorded in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory on a regular basis (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). The range in South Australia appears to have contracted, with only irregular recent records of small flocks or individual birds from the south-east of the state. Population size and trends are poorly known.<br/><br/>In 1987-1988, the breeding population was estimated at 5,000 birds, including 1,320 breeding pairs, and in 1995-1996, at 940 breeding pairs (Brereton 1996). Annual surveys across the non-breeding range fluctuate depending on the distribution of the birds across the landscape and flock sizes (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). In 2010 mainland surveys recorded 2,158 birds, including immatures, the highest count for many years (C. Tzaros and D. Ingwersen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2010). Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2011) estimate that the population probably contains around 2,000 mature individuals and is declining, however a population viability analysis model predicted that the population will decline by an average of 87% (79-95%) over three generations (12-18 years) (Heinsohn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.<strong> </strong>Management actions completed or underway include regular population surveys in Tasmania and throughout the mainland range, utilising a large network of volunteers (Saunders<em> et al</em>. 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (coordinated by the Swift Parrot Recovery Team and the Threatened Bird Network), addition of areas of critical habitat to the conservation reserve system in Victoria, development and refinement of guidelines for forestry in <em>E. globulus</em> and box-ironbark forests (at identified priority sites), development of community awareness programmes and revegetation and habitat rehabilitation.

On Maud Island it uses areas with a high canopy cover and low understory and ground cover (Ortiz-Catedral 2012). It requires mature trees with natural hollows or cavities for nesting. Monitoring has revealed that 80% of nests are in mature living trees, with the remaining 20% in dead trees (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2012)<strong></strong>. Of those nests found in mature trees, 68% are in red beech <em>Nothofagus fusca</em>.<em> </em>Breeding is linked with the irregular seeding of <em>Nothofagus</em> when numbers can increase substantially, and it seems that populations may fluctuate significantly in line with breeding/seeding events (T. Greene <em>in litt. </em>2016). In mast years, many pairs will lay a second clutch, and some may lay a third clutch, with breeding continuing through the austral winter. First clutches may average more than eight eggs, with second clutches averaging over seven in 2011. A study on Maud Island has shown that birds form pairs at around seven years of age, and nest in a variety of natural cavities where beech is unavailable (J. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011, 2012)<strong></strong>. It feeds on seeds, fruits, leaves, flowers, buds and invertebrates (Kearvell 1999, Kearvell 2013)<strong></strong>.","The impact of introduced predators, principally stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em> and rats <em>Rattus</em> spp., is likely to be the primary cause of decline (Higgins 1999)<strong></strong>, with recent population crashes being due to rat irruptions. The species's hole-nesting behaviour leads to a reduced ratio of females in the population due to predation of birds on the nest (Elliott <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. Silviculture of beech forests aims to harvest trees at an age when few will be mature enough to develop suitable cavities, so sufficient nest holes are unlikely in managed beech forest (Kearwell 2002)<strong></strong>. The species forages in low-growing shrubs and such lower forest levels have been subject to heavy browsing by cattle, deer and possums, altering the forest structure (Duncan and van Hal 2004)<strong></strong>. The population on Chalky Island may suffer competition from&#160;Yellow-crowned Parakeet&#160;<em>C. auriceps </em>(J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011) and in time, this problem may affect other island populations. Population growth in island populations, especially on Maud Island, may also be limited through predation by falcons (Falconidae), and displacement of two nesting pairs by introduced Common Starlings <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sturnus vulgaris</span> has now been documented; the overall impact of this recently-identified threat is uncertain, but may be minimal (J. C. Kearvell<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012, 2013). <br/><br/>In 2008, it was confirmed that native Red-crowned Parakeets <em>C. novaezelandiae</em> on Little Barrier Island were suffering from psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The virus has been sequenced and appears very similar to the strain found in Crimson Rosella <em>Platycercus elegans</em>, in which the disease is known to be endemic within the captive population. In 2009, some individuals of <em>C. malherbi</em> on Maud Island were showing some symptoms consistent with PBFD. In reaction, testing of the entire captive population has been undertaken, as well as more limited sampling of individuals in all three island populations, as well as other parrot species. Results indicate that antibodies for PBFD were detected in <em>C. malherbi</em> from both Maud Island and the captive-rearing unit; notably in the latter case antibodies were found in the <em>C. novaezelandiae</em> foster parents (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011), and the disease has now been found in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. auriceps</span> in the Eglington Valley, Fiordland (J. C. Kearvell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, 2013).

C. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2013).<br/></span></span>","Although the population numbered several hundreds prior to 2000, a prolific increase in the population of rats and stoats within its restricted South Island range induced a rapid population decline and the total population has remained well below its previous levels. Successful translocations on four islands have boosted the population of this species, but decreases may have continued on the mainland. Overall, the global population was estimated at&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">290-690  individuals in early 2013, with the mainland populations estimated to  total 130-270 individuals and the island populations totaling 160-420  individuals&#160;(J. C. Kearvell&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;Obtaining accurate population estimates is extremely challenging for the species, but recent counts indicate that the mainland population may have declined to around 100 birds, and the offshore island populations to around 250 birds in total (J.C. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2016). The population has a skewed sex ratio of males to females, probably due to higher predation on incubating females (Kearvell and Farley 2016).",Stable,"Formerly occurring throughout <strong>New Zealand, </strong>the species&#160;is now known from only three beech (<em>Nothofagus </em>spp.) forest valleys in the South Island: the Hawdon and Poulter valleys in Arthur’s Pass National Park and the South Branch of the Hurunui valley in Lake Sumner Forest Park.&#160;They are patchily distributed within these valleys; absent in many parts but in some places can be quite common (Kearvell 2013). In 1999-2000, the population crashed from perhaps 500-700 birds to a  rough estimate of 100-200 as a result of ship rat irruptions in two  successive summers (<strong></strong>J. van Hal <em>in litt. </em>2008, 2009)<strong></strong>. <br/>Translocations to islands began in 2005, with 68 individuals now released on Maud and 61 individuals on Blumine Islands in the Marlborough Sounds, 46 individuals on Chalky Island in Fiordland, and 95 individuals on Tuhua/Mayor Island in the Bay of Plenty (J.C Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2013, A. Grant <em>in litt. </em>2016). These releases all appeared highly successful at first with positive  signs of breeding and population establishment - however, population  growth has now slowed on all islands and the persistence of these  populations appears to still be tenuous (A. Grant <em>in litt. </em>2016). Releases of&#160;captive-raised birds to the South Branch of the Hurunui to augment the population in 2015 and 2016 appear to have been successful with released birds having successfully paired and 9-10 nests located in 2016 (J. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2016,&#160;A. Grant <em>in litt. </em>2016). Overall, the population appears to stabilize at low levels, and it is likely that the mainland populations remains at an extremely low level of around 100 birds in total (J.

Hawdon and Poulter valleys are located within Arthur's Pass National Park and the Hurunui South Branch is in Lake Sumner Conservation Park (<strong></strong>J. van Hal <em>in litt. </em>2008, 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Monitoring and conservation of this species is problematic given the difficulty in separating it from <em>C. auriceps</em>. The Hurunui population is contained within a ""mainland island"" which aims to protect and restore two river valleys through integrated pest management, including minimising numbers of <em>Mustela erminea </em>and <em>Rattus rattus</em>. Monitoring of nests will verify whether this is allowing numbers to stabilise and expand. The Hawdon population received <em>M. erminea</em> control only during plague years, which occur, on average, every four years (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. However, following the dramatic decline in the parakeet population after failure to effectively control predators, rat poisoning and stoat trapping are more extensive within the Hurunui ""mainland island"" (Keey 2004)<strong></strong>. All three valleys are now part of the ""Battle for our Birds"" initiative targeting rats and stoats in South Island beech forest sites. The control of <em>M. erminea </em>is now continuous, whereas control measures against rats are implemented when populations reach trigger points (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011, 2013)<strong></strong>. Every nest found is also individually protected with tin tree wraps (to prevent access by predators), ground predator traps and possum traps (<strong></strong>J. van Hal <em>in litt. </em>2008, 2009), and since 2003 only one nest out of 153 has been lost to invasive predators (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. <br/><br/>Since 2003, the captive facility at Isaacs Construction Wildlife Centre, Peacock Springs (Christchurch), has released, in conjunction with Department of Conservation, a total of over 250 individuals&#160;(J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2012)<strong></strong>. Since 2005, individuals have been translocated to Chalky Island in Fiordland, which is free from predators (Duncan and van Hal 2004)<strong></strong>. The reintroduction of birds to Maud Island has been underway since 2007, and wild-bred birds are now nesting on the island. Translocations to Tuhua Island have been taking place since December 2009, and in early 2011 it was expected that all birds produced in the next captive breeding season would be released there to provide a sufficient founder population (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011)<strong></strong>. Translocations have also been carried out on Blumine  Island (J. C.&#160; Kearvell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). A second captive-breeding group was being set up at Mount Bruce but has been discontinued due to a lack of capacity (J. C. Kearvell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2013). Another attempt to set up a second captive breeding population has been initiated with the Auckland Zoo with the hope that a 5th island population will be started on Rotoroa Island (T. Greene <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;A study to assess the genetic diversity of the remnant mainland population, with the aim of ensuring that any new founder populations on islands are as genetically diverse as possible, has been completed (J.

Reasons for this recent decline are unclear, though the species has suffered from previous loss, fragmentation and degradation of winter habitat, and changes to fire regime in the breeding habitat. Likely causes of the recent decline are an outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease in 2014 and the effects of a ten-year drought on productivity of saltmarsh plants in the winter habitat that reduced the breeding condition of females. It is also likely that the lack of habitat burns in the preferred breeding habitat has reduced the availability and quality of preferred food plants. The species is therefore classified as Critically Endangered.<p></p>","The Orange-bellied Parrot breeds in a mosaic of eucalypt forest and rainforest bordering extensive moorland plains. Nesting occurs in tree hollows and the species feeds on the seeds of a range of grasses and sedges in moorlands. There is some evidence that early in the breeding season birds prefer to forage in areas burnt seven to 15 years earlier, whilst later in the breeding season they prefer areas burnt three to five years earlier (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011). After breeding, Orange-bellied Parrots migrate to saltmarshes, dunes, beaches, pastures and shrublands close to the coast (&lt;5 km), where there they feed on the ground or in low vegetation, almost exclusively on seeds, mainly of salt-tolerant coastal and saltmarsh plants (Loyn<em> et al</em>. 1986, Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011).<br/><p></p>","The primary reason for the species's rarity is thought to be its specialist habitat requirements, and fragmentation and degradation of winter habitat by grazing, agriculture and urban and industrial development. Changes have also occurred in the breeding habitat, where there has been reduction of fire, which would normally produce favourable habitat structure for the species. Up until the 1990s, fire was regularly used by small-scale tin miners to reduce vegetation cover to aid mining and protect assets, coincidentally producing high quality foraging habitat for the species. Management of the area is now subject to stricter use of fire by the land manager and due to a combination of lack of resources and risk aversion, habitat management burns have rarely been implemented. This has resulted in a gradual decline in the habitat quality for the species. Disease is an important threat to the tiny population. An outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in 2015 infected 19 out of 26 wild Orange-bellied Parrot nestlings tested (Anon. 2015). One adult also tested positive for the disease. This contributed to a decline in the wild population from 35 to 23 mature individuals in 2016. Competition with introduced seed-eating finches may have affected winter food availability, while some former breeding habitat may have been vacated because of a change in the fire regime and competition with introduced Common Starlings <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>, which fill nest-hollows with nesting material, rendering them unsuitable. The introduced Sugar Glider <em>Petaurus breviceps</em> is also implicated as a predator of incubating females, eggs and nestlings during the Birch's Inlet release and is a known threat to other species including the Swift Parrot (Stojanovic <em>et al</em>. 2014). Sugar Gliders are absent from Melaleuca and therefore may have had an influence on the contraction of the breeding range. Deaths from random events, such as predation by foxes and cats, or disease, are significant threats to such a tiny population. Ongoing degradation of remaining saltmarsh habitat on the mainland is a significant threat (C. Tzaros and M.A. Weston <em>in litt. </em>2003). A ten-year drought reduced productivity of saltmarsh plants in the winter habitat, reducing the breeding condition of females.&#160;Windfarm developments may kill about one bird per year (Smales <em>et al. </em>2005). Due to the low population size, the species is highly susceptible to genetic Allee effects, which might lead to further population reductions (Crates <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><p></p>","Surveys in early 2010 found fewer than 50 birds at Melaleuca and found no birds at any other historical breeding areas. The wild population was therefore estimated to contain fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals in 2010.&#160;The total wild population at the end of the 2015/16 season was only 35 (M. Holdsworth <em>in litt. </em>2016) and has decreased to 14 in 2017. The sex ratio is highly skewed (12 males and 2 females) (D. Stojanovic <em>in litt.</em> 2017). Captive breeding programmes have been carried out since 1986 to restock the wild population, with more than 300 individuals in different breeding centres in Australia and Tasmania (BirdLife Australia <em>in litt</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"This species breeds only in south-western Tasmania, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia</span>. The current known breeding population is only found at one small site, at Melaleuca, but the historical distribution was more extensive and unsuccessful attempts were made to re-establish&#160;a population at Birch’s Inlet.&#160;Birds migrate to the mainland after breeding, sometimes stopping over on King Island, and overwintering at coastal sites in south-eastern South Australia and Victoria. Annual winter counts in Victoria, South Australia and Bass Strait from 1979 to 1990 varied between 67 and 122, with no significant change in numbers (Starks <em>et al.</em> 1992). Numbers recorded in mainland surveys have since declined, for example 48 birds recorded from 19 sites in 2007 (Saunders 2008). The overall population, which was estimated to number around 150 individuals in 2005 (M. Holdsworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2005), has since undergone a rapid decline (confirmed by data from both breeding and wintering sites): surveys in early 2010 found fewer than 50 birds at Melaleuca and no birds at any other historical breeding areas (Sims 2010). The wild population was therefore estimated to contain fewer than 50 individuals in 2010, and extinction in the wild has been predicted to take place within 3-5 years (Sims 2010). More recently, the total post-breeding wild population at Melaleuca was only 35, including 18 juveniles (M. Holdsworth <em>in litt. </em>2016). Based on mean annual survival estimates (Holdsworth <em>et al.</em> 2011) the return of mature individuals in 2016/17 was predicted to be 20-25. Low breeding participation of females appears to be a limiting factor in some years, with some females not breeding every year (Sims 2010).&#160;Only 12 and 13 young are known to have fledged at Melaleuca in 2008/09 and 2009/10 respectively, and urgent action was taken in 2010/11 to secure the captive population by the collection of 21 of 27 young as founders in that year (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011). In recent years the output of fledglings has recovered somewhat with an average of 25/year (14-39/year). The captive insurance population has expanded in recent years and by April 2016 consisted of about 325 individuals held at ten facilities under a cooperative breeding programme and is considered to be secure (A. Everaardt <em>in litt. 2</em>016). Re-establishment of the Orange-bellied Parrot at Birch's Inlet was attempted during the period 1999-2009 with a total of 410 captive-bred birds being released, which produced 71 wild-bred fledglings. However, the reintroduction attempt failed because mean annual adult survival of released birds was 0.30 - half that of wild birds (0.65) - and the low fertility rate of 0.55 mimics the low fertility of the captive population (0.57), which is significantly less than in wild birds (0.86). Breeding output at this site was further limited by nest competition and depredation.&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. A recovery team was established in 1980, a wide range of research projects are ongoing, and awareness-raising and education programmes are conducted. Much feeding habitat in Tasmania (including King Island), Victoria and South Australia has been reserved or is managed. Breeding, migration and winter counts are made annually, and almost 100% of the wild population is colour-banded. A captive breeding programme has been established and the population of about 350 birds is held at 10 institutions under a cooperative captive breeding effort. The captive population is predominantly derived from six founders collected in the 1980s (perhaps leading to low egg fertility as a result of inbreeding depression) but more recently has been bolstered by the inclusion of 21 new founders collected in 2010. Captive-bred birds that have been released have apparently migrated successfully between their breeding and wintering grounds (Loyn <em>et al. </em>2005, Anon. 2014), but few birds released on the breeding grounds return in the following breeding season (Troy and Gales&#160;2016), suggesting that most released birds fail to migrate or survive to the following year. As the population is severely male biased (six males per one female), a higher proportion of females is released in spring to correct the sex ratio  imbalance (Stojanovic et al. 2017). The survival rate and reproductive success of captive-reared birds are far lower&#160;than for wild birds (Holdsworth 2006, Holdsworth <em>et al.</em> 2011, Stojanovic <em>et al</em>. 2017). Moreover, the plumage of captive-bred birds is in poorer condition, which might prove to be energetically costly, especially during migration (Stojanovic<em> et al</em>. 2017). Of &#160;53 captive birds released in 2014 and 2015, just six survived to return to Melaleuca. An additional 27 captive bred individuals were released at Melaleuca in 2015. The behaviour of released birds has been monitored, and differs in many respects from those of wild parrots (Penrose 2016). <br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Survey all saltmarsh in wintering range using satellite imagery.

It prefers forest edge, including near cultivated areas and will visit parks and gardens. It is well-adapted to secondary forest in Singapore (D. L. Yong <em>in litt</em>. 2016).

Conservative estimates of numbers suggest that all subpopulations are extremely small.

K. Herzog <em>in litt. </em>2007) and it now inhabits subtropical, xerophytic thorny scrub with many cacti and scattered trees at 1,100-2,700 m, dispersing locally to 3,000 m. It nests and roosts on undisturbed, steep-sided river cliffs, with a small population breeding in palms (Rojas <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Its diet includes seeds and fruit, but natural food sources are often scarce and birds feed extensively on crops, particularly groundnuts and unripe maize (Kyle 2005). Egg-laying takes place in February and March, with pairs fledging one, two or occasionally three offspring annually<strong> </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998, S. K. Herzog <em>in litt. </em>2007, A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2015). Adults and their young remain on the breeding grounds until May, after which they congregate in a few large flocks in agricultural areas  and roost communally in large trees (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). Even though the breeding sites are separated by only 10-60 km and  individuals from different colonies forage together outside of the  breeding season, the species shows a clear genetic sub-structure with  almost no gene flow between colonies, which has been attributed to a  strong natal phylopatry (J. L. Tella <em>in litt.</em> 2017). <p></p>","Its original natural habitat is inter-Andean dry forest but this has been degraded to thorn and cactus scrub by centuries (if not millennia) of highly unsustainable human activities, nowadays mainly overgrazing by goats, firewood cutting and charcoal production<strong> </strong>(S. K. Herzog <em>in litt. </em>2007). An estimated 40% of natural vegetation in valleys within its range had been converted to agriculture by 1991, with other areas degraded by intense grazing. Several important food trees are harvested for fuel and charcoal. As food plants are lost, agricultural land is used more, thereby increasing the species's exposure to persecution as a crop-pest, and the use of firearms for pest control has been recorded<strong> </strong>(Brace <em>et al.</em> 1995). Macaws are also potentially threatened by pesticides applied to crops where macaws forage mostly during the non-breeding season (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). Illegal trapping continues, but has been reduced as a result of legal protection<strong></strong> (Pitter and Christiansen 1995,&#160;<strong></strong>Juniper and Parr 1998, Herrera and Hennessey 2007,<strong> </strong>A. Rojas <em>in litt. </em>2007). The majority of the Bolivian parrot trade is domestic, but more valuable threatened species end up in Peru or further afield. 26 Red-fronted Macaws were recorded passing through the Los Pozos pet market, Santa Cruz between August 2004-July 2005, and there are four other wildlife markets in the city and others in Cochabamba, suggesting this figure may only represent a small proportion of birds illegally trafficked in the country<strong> </strong>(Herrera and Hennessey 2007). In 2011, 45 Red-fronted Macaws were recorded in houses; some had been taken from nests as nestlings, but most of them were trapped when foraging in crops. In 2017, more than 100 individuals were found as cage birds in local communities (J. L. Tella <em>in litt.</em> 2017). Most were kept as pets, but some were to sell to in major cities (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012). The two main threats appear to be nest-poaching and trapping for local pet supply, and persecution as crop pests (especially in corn and peanut cultivations), and possibly contamination by pesticides applied to crops  (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella <em>in litt. </em>2012, J. L. Tella <em>in litt</em>. 2017). <br/><p></p>","The population is estimated to number at most 600 individuals.

Previously thought to be heavily dependent on closed-canopy primary forest, on Sulawesi it is a bird of forest savanna and more open habitats and does not occur in primary forest (Anon. 2012), and on Sumba the availability of nesting trees is critical but the species may not require large areas of forest (D.

Breeding takes place from September to May on Sumba (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>.

Large-scale logging and conversion of forest to agriculture across its range has exacerbated the decline, and the use of pesticides since around 1989 is a further potential threat. At least formerly, the species was regarded as a crop pest, and consequently persecuted; and it may also be hunted for fun (H. Bashari&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016). A shift from cultivation of corn, papaya and other foodstuffs to rice on Sumba may consequently have reduced food availability for the species (Nandika and Agustina 2012).

Conversely, rainfall on Komodo has been low in recent years leading to limited availability of water sources. Juvenile Komodo Dragons <em>Varanus komodensis</em>&#160;pose a threat to nestlings on Komodo (Nandika and Agustina 2012).

This total is roughly equivalent to 2,000 mature individuals, and so the global population size is best placed in the range 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to <strong>Timor-Leste</strong> and <strong>Indonesia</strong>, where it was formerly common throughout Nusa Tenggara (from Bali to Timor), on Sulawesi and its satellite islands, and the Masalembu Islands (in the Java Sea). It has undergone a dramatic decline, which is still ongoing, particularly in the last quarter of the 20th century, such that it is now extinct on many islands and close to extinction on most others. Sumba appears to support the largest remaining population, tentatively estimated in 1992 at c.3,200 birds, but was reported to be declining by perhaps 500 birds annually, with just 10% of the island still forested in 34 fragments (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005), and extrapolations across remaining forest cover from numbers in six IBAs suggesting just 563 birds in 2012 (Burung Indonesia <em>in prep</em>.<strong></strong>). Other significant populations are on Komodo (c.500 individuals, but potentially now fewer), Sulawesi and Buton (combined remaining population of perhaps 200 individuals but almost extirpated from Buton by 2009 [Anon. 2012, Waugh 2013]), Sumbawa (107 birds in a recent census [Anon. 2013], although the population may be smaller [C.

Tiny populations of just a few individuals also exist in the Tukangbesi Islands, on Oroho Island (a satellite of Wangi Wangi Island) and on Lintea Selatan (a satellite of Tomea Island) (D.

Its current status on several small islands is unclear, but surveys of Masakambing in the Masalembu Islands in 2008 found only ten individuals remaining of race <em>abbotti</em><strong> </strong>(Anon 2008, Metz <em>et al.</em> 2009, Nandika <em>et al.</em> 2009), with only eight recorded in 2009 (Nandika <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>, but increasing slightly to 11 in 2010 and 13 in 2011 (Anon. 2012). Local information suggests that the species was extirpated from Masalembu Island in 1987, owing largely to the trapping and killing of birds that accompanied the exploration of the archipelago in the late 1980s (Nandika <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. A feral population of several hundred birds exists in Hong Kong, outside of the species's natural range. It is likely extirpated from Lombok (F. Verbelen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I (2005). A cooperative recovery plan has been developed and adopted, and an update was prepared in 2012 (D. Mulyawati <em>in litt. </em>2012). This species has become a national priority in Indonesia for increasing its population by the Ministy of Forestry and Environment (H. Bashari <em>in litt. </em>2016). Populations occur in several protected areas, the most important being Rawa Aopa Watumohai (55 individuals in 2011 [Waugh 2013]) and Caraente National Parks (on Sulawesi) which supports up to 100 individuals (Nandika 2006)<strong></strong>, Suaka Margasatwa Nature Reserve on Pulau Moyo, Komodo National Park and two national parks on Sumba: Manupeu-Tanadaru and Laiwangi-Wanggameti. The declared Nini Konis Santana National Park in Timor holds an estimated 100 birds (Trainor<em> et al.</em> undated)<strong></strong>. In Rawa Aopa Watumohai nests have been protected from predators by removing overhanging vegetation and fitting plastic collars around the trunks of nesting trees (Waugh 2013). Moratoria on international trade are in place, although it is likely that a large proportion of the trade is domestic. Several cockatoo subpopulations have increased on Sumba between 1992 and 2002,  due to conservation efforts (including local education, eco-tourism and law enforcement), although densities remained below those typical of other cockatoo species (Cahill <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Capture for trade has apparently decreased dramatically on Sumba thanks to a variety of awareness-raising activities and community protection measures (D. Mulyawati <em>in litt. </em>2012).&#160;<br/><br/>Following surveys in 2008 and 2009, the Indonesian Parrot Project and Konservasi Kakatua Indonesia have initiated meetings with community leaders and villagers on Masakambing and Masalembu, as well as the local military and police, to raise awareness and garner support for the species's conservation (Metz <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. A conservation-awareness-pride programme has also begun to engage both adults and school children of the Masalembu Archipelago (Metz <em>et al.</em> 2009, Nandika <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong> and in south-east Sulawesi (Anon. 2012). A 'village regulation' was drafted to make it illegal to trap, own or transport the species, and to initiate measures to reduce habitat destruction and employ a former village head to monitor and protect nests and study the species (Nandika <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. Similar community-based regulations have been put in place by the Moronone community in Rawa Aopa Watumohai NP, where four village members have been hired as Forest Wardens (Anon. 2012). The wardens protect the species against poachers and carry out monitoring activities (Waugh 2013). The species's pest status may be tackled by the planting of crops to compensate for losses and to act as a 'sacrifice crop', for instance sunflower fields are used to attract the species away from other crops (Waugh 2013). Mangrove restoration is also being used to increase available nesting habitat (Waugh 2013). A repeated census of the <em>abbotti</em> population is planned, along with studies into its life history and ecology (Metz <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct further surveys (including Roti but also further surveys on Alor and Pantar) to identify the most appropriate areas for conservation action and to periodically monitor key populations by repeating surveys conducted 8-10 years ago. Provide support for relevant protected areas and conservation initiatives within its range and protect nest trees where possible. Strengthen protection of the Poronumbu Forest, Sumba, by declaring it a Nature Reserve (Nandika and Agustina 2012). Strengthen control, law enforcement  and monitoring of trade and establish greater management of captive populations. <span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content"">Improve law enforcement in designated protected areas and other key areas for trade including ports, markets, etc. Promote widespread community-based conservation initiatives. For instance on Pasoso Island, Central Sulawesi, work to protect the species should involve engaging with the five families that live on the island and introduce community engagement programmes for children and adults on several of the other islands where the species is found (Nandika and Agustina 2012). Recommendations made specifically for the protection of the species in Komodo National Park were to conduct annual monitoring, maintain regular patrols, raise awareness in local communities and study human activities and impacts within the park (Imansyah <em>et al</em>. 2005, Benstead 2006)<strong></strong>. Conduct ecological research to clarify options for its management and conservation. Additional targets should be to study the abundance and distribution of nest holes and water sources. Providing artificial water sources near nest locations, i.e water ponds, is essential for the species on Komodo Island and protecting nests from juvenile Komodo Dragons on Komodo may also be necessary (Nandika and Agustina 2012).<p></p>",Indomalayan|Oceanian,,false,false,Global

In 1991, an estimated minimum of 6,600 birds (possibly representing a mere quarter of the actual figure) were taken from the wild. Catch quotas for the species were exceeded by up to 18 times in some localities, indicating that trappers were removing in the order of 17% of the population annually. In 2007, the catch quota was 10 pairs, and only for breeding purposes. However, an investigation by ProFauna revealed that  at least 200 White Cockatoo were caught from the wild in North  Halmahera in 2007, far exceeding the quota (ProFauna<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2008). Illegal trade continues and is probably grossly underestimated, with many birds being smuggled through Sulawesi and ending up in the bird markets of western Indonesia or being transported to the Philippines (S. Metz <em>in litt. </em>2013). Although forest within parts of its range remains relatively intact, exploitation by logging companies has become intensive, and some areas are have been cleared for agriculture and mining.&#160; Vetter (2009) estimated that forest loss within the geographic and elevation range of <em>C. alba</em> was c.20.2% between 1990 and 2003, and projected the loss of c.65.4% of forest in its range over the next three generations. Significant changes in forest cover on Halmahera appear to have driven a concomitant decline in the cockatoo population (F.

Therefore, the species is now listed as Least Concern.<p></p>","It occurs in a variety of habitats across its range,  with each subspecies differing in their habitat preferences, but  overall these range from dense forest, to modified wooded habitats,  cultivation and open areas.&#160;<br/><p></p>","Overall, the area and quality of this species's habitats are in continuing and projected  decline owing to the impacts of introduced species across its range  (Gula <em>et al. </em>2010, Garnett <em>et al</em>. 2011), forest  management practices and expected nickel mining on New Caledonia.  On-going declines are inferred to be taking place in the population as a  result of habitat loss, introduced predators (e.g. on New Caledonia and  Stewart Island [G. Harper <em>in litt.</em> 2005, 2012; Harper 2009]), and potentially owing to Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (Ortiz-Catedral <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The nominate subspecies is adversely affected by forestry operations: clear-felling and burning have drastically reduced available habitat, and selective logging may reduce the number of trees with suitable nesting holes and foraging opportunities. Irruptions in the 19th century may have been caused by increased cultivation of crops by European settlers. It was hunted for food by Maori, and was formerly persecuted because birds damaged crops and gardens. It may suffer through competition for food or breeding sites with introduced species (such as the Common Myna <em>Acridotheres tristis</em>, Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>, Eastern Rosella <em>Platycercus eximius</em>, Crimson Rosella <em>P. elegans</em>, common brushtail possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula </em>and honey bees <em>Apis mellifera</em>). Introduced predators such as cats, rats and stoats may also impact the species. An outbreak of beak-and-feather disease has been confirmed in the population on Little Barrier Island. This has the potential to cause significant mortality, although effects on the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. novaezelandiae</span> population have not yet been studied (Ortiz-Catedral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>cookii</em> has been affected by the clearance of forests before 1950, for timber, agriculture and pasture,  severely reducing suitable habitat. Since then, increasing weed invasion  has dramatically altered the structure and composition of remaining  native vegetation. The degradation of native plant communities has been  linked with a reduction in the nutrient input to the island, caused by  the decimation of formerly large populations of burrow-nesting seabirds  by introduced mammalian predators (Holdaway in prep.). Though forest  clearance has stopped, recovery requires new habitat to become  available. Nest-site availability has been further reduced by  competition with introduced Crimson Rosella <em>Platycercus elegans</em> and, to a lesser extent, Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris </em>and feral honey bees. Most known nest failures have resulted from predation by introduced black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em>.  Feral cats are also thought to be significant predators and, although  the level of predation is unquantified, anecdotal reports have been  alarming (M. Christian<em> in litt.</em> 2007). There is a high level of Psittacine Circoviral Disease (PCD) in the population, which has resulted in some mortality.<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>saisseti</em> is only common in the south of New Caledonia, in sites at risk from nickel mining, and so  may suffer significant habitat loss in the near future.

Populations currently exist on the Kermadec islands, Three Kings, some Hauraki Gulf islands, Kapiti Island, Stewart Island and surrounding islands, Chatham Islands, Snares, Antipodes Islands, and as a hybrid swarm (with Yellow-crowned Parakeet <em>C. auriceps</em>) on Auckland Islands. The subspecies from Lord Howe Island (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">subflavescens</span>) and Macquarie Island (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">erythrotis</span>) went extinct at the end of the 19th century (Hindwood 1940, Taylor 1979). Past population estimates suggest the total population was in excess of 20,000 individuals, but historically the island populations were part of an effectively panmictic population. When the mainland linking populations became extinct, the island populations became isolated, and their effective population sizes are now much reduced. Declines are likely to be taking place on Stewart Island (by inference from measured declines of other species, owing to rat and cat predation), although any decline has been minimal (G.

It was once found throughout the island, and estimated to number at  least 190 pairs. It is now confined to the Norfolk Island National Park  and adjacent forested areas and orchards (Hill 2002). In 1994, the  declining population consisted of only four breeding females and 28-33  males. Conservation management measures have allowed the population to  grow, and numbers were estimated at a possible 200-300 individuals in  2004, and 150-200 birds in 2008. However, recent observations of  disappearance from places where it was once common, and evi­dence of cat  predation (M. Christian, R. Ward and J.

The wild bird and the <em>P. maracana</em> apparently produced infertile eggs, although one experienced very early embryo death, subsequent DNA analysis revealing a hybrid. <p></p>","The decline of the species has generally been attributed to two principal factors. First, long-term destruction of the specific gallery woodland habitat on which the species apparently depended, the result of the colonisation and exploitation of the region along the rio São Francisco corridor during more than three centuries. Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record. The remaining caatinga habitat has suffered degradation and clearance as a result of grazing by cattle and goats (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012).",The species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild (Butchart <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2018).,,"This species was known for over 150 years, from small numbers of traded birds and a hunted bird taken by von Spix, until it was traced in 1985-1986 to near the rio São Francisco in north Bahia, <strong>Brazil</strong>. Only three birds remained and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw <em>Propyrrhura maracana</em>, was discovered at the site in July 1990. A female <em>C. spixii</em> was released from captivity in 1995 and initially paired with the male. Unfortunately, the female disappeared from the release site after seven weeks and is suspected to have collided with a power-line<strong></strong> (Caparroz <em>et al. </em>2001). The wild bird was still paired with the female <em>P. maracana</em> in January 2000 (Y. de Melo Barros <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000) but neither bird has been seen since the end of that year. In 2000, the total number of publicly declared birds in captivity was 60, but 54 of these were captive-bred (Schischakin 2000). The official captive population in 2015 totalled over 100 individuals (EcoAmericas 2015), with further individuals in private ownership. There have been occasional local reports, including from Serra da Capivara National Park, and a bird was filmed near Curaçá in June 2016, but this is now thought to have been a release from captivity.

It appears to be a strictly arboreal forager, feeding mainly on native plants and taking a wide range of parts including buds, young shoots, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, twigs and even bark and sap (Jones 1987, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. They return to favoured food trees, some of which have been used for generations (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Birds forage singly or in small groups in different areas at different seasons and are known to travel several kilometers to and from feeding areas in search of food, although the dwarf forest and scrublands of the south-west plateau are an important foraging area throughout the year (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>. Nesting takes place in natural cavities in native trees (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. It is monogamous, but breeding units in the 1970s and 1980s often comprised a group of one female with up to three males, one of which was dominant and mated with and fed the female (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The presence of extra males was probably the result of a formerly skewed sex ratio; pairs are usually hostile to extra males, who seem to have no positive effect on fledging success, which is probably related to the experience of the dominant male (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Clutch size is 1-4 (but normally 2-3) eggs, which are laid from September-December (Thorsen and Jones 1998<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span><strong></strong> Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>, and incubation, by the female, lasts 21-25 days (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The population currently experiences high rates of egg fertility (84%), high hatchability of fertile eggs (82%) and fledging success of hatched young (76%) (Jones<em> et al</em>. 2013). One to two chicks are usually fledged, though up to four have been recorded (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998, 2013)<strong></strong> from the end of October to the beginning of February or later, and fledgling parakeets are reputed to stay with their parents, being fed by them for at least 2-3 months after leaving the nest (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>.&#160;<p></p>","This species's earlier decline and contracting distribution corresponds to the severe destruction and degradation of its native habitat (Jones 1987, Greenwood 1996<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The population crashed from a likely total of several thousand following forest destruction and the replacement of its favoured feeding habitat, upland dwarf forest, with plantations (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. In 1996, only 5% of the island was covered with native vegetation (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The areas of upland native forest that remain continue to be highly degraded by cyclones, the influences of past forestry practices, the spread of introduced plants such as guava <em>Psidium cattleianum</em>, privet <em>Ligustrum robustum</em> and jamrosa <em>Syzygium jambos</em> and the effect of introduced feral mammals such as pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em> and rusa deer <em>Rusa timorensis</em> (Greenwood 1996<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span> Thorsen and Jones 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The production of native fruit, on which the parakeet feeds, and regeneration of potential nest trees is thus poor (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. Recent research suggests that food shortage due to deterioration of the native forest is the major cause of nest failure; although exotics can provide an abundant food source it is not available year-round or even throughout the breeding season (Thorsen and Jones 1998)<strong></strong>. Crab-eating macaques <em>Macaca fascicularis</em> and black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> are amongst a number of introduced arboreal species which pose a threat to parakeets by raiding nests and competing for native fruits (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>.

Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000, V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. The decline in the number of old native trees, which are lost to storm damage and senescence, has intensified competition for nesting cavities, with 14-19% of <em>P. eques</em> cavities lost to competitors each year (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Infestations of nest fly larvae can be severe in some years and, without intervention, would kill many young (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Despite the rapid outbreak of a novel genotype of the virus that causes Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in the 2004/2005 season (Kundu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), the impact of the disease on the population appears to have been thus far negligible, limited to a brief reduction in hatching success (Tollington&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<p></p>","At the end of the 2016/2017 breeding season, the population was estimated at c.756 birds.

Tatayah and S. Henshaw <em>in litt</em>. 2019). The species’s decline and contracting distribution was likely caused by the severe and large-scale destruction and degradation of its forest habitat for conversion into plantations (Jones 1987, Greenwood 1996, Jones<em> et al.</em> 1998).&#160;<br/><br/>Since then, intense conservation efforts have aided the continuous recovery of the species (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013). By now, the largest part of the population is confined to restricted areas of the Black River Gorges National Park (6,800 ha) in southwestern Mauritius. Reintroductions of captive-bred birds there ceased in 2005/2006 (C. Jones <em>in litt</em>. 2019), following the outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD). Currently, two additional populations are being established in other parts of Mauritius: between 2015 and 2017, wild-born individuals were translocated to the Bambous Mountains on the East Coast of the island, where breeding could be confirmed in 2018, and this population is deemed self-sustaining (V.

Another translocation programme started in early 2018 to establish a population in Chamarel in the south-west; however this population has not been breeding yet (V. Tatayah and S.

The dramatic increase in the species's population in recent years is undoubtedly due to an intensive programme to manage the wild population combined with a highly successful captive breeding programme since the 1993/1994 breeding season (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong> - a collaborative effort of  the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, the World Parrot Trust, the Mauritian Government and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust Society (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Between 1997 and 2004, when reintroductions were completed, a total of 139 captive reared birds were released (Jones 2010). Clutch and brood manipulations of wild nests were carried out between 1994 and 2005 to increase productivity and obtain individuals for captive breeding (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2013). The intensity of conservation management was reduced in 2005 to reduce the risk of the spread of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013). Current conservation management measures are more hands-off and directed towards maximising wild survival and recruitment (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Nest cavity improvement is carried out to address a shortage in the availability of quality natural breeding sites. This involves modifications to protect against weather, competitors, and predators (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Nest parasites (nest flies and mites) are controlled via the addition of pesticide-treated substrate. Artificial nest boxes were first used for breeding in 2000, with uptake steadily increasing since. The majority of breeding pairs nested in artificial nest boxes in the 2010/2011 breeding season, and productivity was higher at these sites compared with natural cavities (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Supplementary feeding in the form of commercially produced parrot pellets was provided consistently since 1997, and as of the 2010/2011 season was consumed by over 50% of the population. Consumption of supplementary food is associated with the production of larger clutches, more eggs hatched per clutch, and more individuals fledged per brood (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Habitat management has been directed at increasing the productivity of native forest and has included the foundation in 1993 of the Black River National Park in 6,574 ha of native forest (Jones and Hartley 1995, Greenwood 1996), including most of the species's remaining habitat (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. There are 14 Conservation Management Areas (CMAs), ranging from 0.2 to 24 ha, in which native forest is manually cleared of weeds (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Some of these CMAs are heavily utilised by the species as their trees produce bumper crops (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>.&#160;Research has occurred on present and historic genetic variation of the species so that the effects of the population bottleneck can be quantified and current populations managed to preserve maximum genetic diversity (Tollington <em>et al. </em>2013)<strong></strong>. Research into the impact of PBFD is likely to be ongoing for several years (Malham 2007), and has involved intensive screening of birds since 2005 (Richards 2010, V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. Despite the rapid outbreak of a novel genotype of the causative virus in the 2004/2005 season (Kundu <em>et al</em>. 2012), the impact of the disease on the population appears to have been thus far negligible, limited to a brief reduction in hatching success (Tollington <em>et al</em>. 2015). Strict biosecurity protocols are deployed by conservation managers to restrict transmission of disease. An experiment testing the effectiveness of these protocols&#160; has suggested that while they reduced the probability of nestling infection, they were in fact associated with a slight reduction in fledging success (Fogell <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;Recently, wild-born individuals were translocated to the Bambous Mountains on the east coast of Mauritius to establish a new population. Breeding was confirmed there in the 2018/2019 season (S.

Widespread loss of gallery forests could also have had an impact on the species (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2014).

Anecdotal information and small-scale studies have indicated a population decline. For these reasons, the species is listed as Near Threatened.","The species is found in a variety of habitats including scrub (in the Cerrado and Chaco), savanna, palm groves, gallery forest, subtropical woodland and urban areas (Schunk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Collar <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It nests in cavities in large trees and therefore requires old-growth areas (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). In winter in Argentina, it occupies yungas forest and particularly stands of <em>Anadenanthera macrocarpa&#160;</em>(Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It feeds on fruit and seeds of a wide variety of plants including&#160;<em>Melia</em>,<em> Aspidosperma</em>,<em> Prosopis</em>,<em> Schinopsis</em>,&#160;<em>Ziziphus</em>, <em>Citrus</em>, <em>Anadenanthera</em>, <em>Bulnesia</em> and <em>Cercidium</em>&#160;as well as cactus fruit and palm fruit and seeds (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It also feeds on maize and sunflower crops (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It nests in holes in trees or occasionally cliff faces or arboreal termite nests (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It is largely resident, with most of the Chaco population in Argentina migrating to the eastern foothills of the Andes over winter (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). It roosts communally in trees.","Expert opinion of six studied populations indicated that the main threats to the species are agro-industry farming, wood and pulp plantations, agro-industry grazing, capture for the pet trade (local and international), large-scale and selective logging and climate change (Berkunsky <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017a).<br/><br/>The species is very heavily trapped for the cage-bird trade, but the impact on populations is not known. Minimum net exports rose from 10,600 in 1981 to 58,500 in 1988, but declined after that (Collar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Large numbers of individuals continue to be traded illegally within countries (Pires <em>et al. </em>2016, Ortiz-von Halle 2018).&#160;Hundreds of individuals are captured in Brazil every year and nesting sites are frequently destroyed, with many traded between states, and the species is commonly received by government wildlife rehabilitation centres (Schunk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). Data shows that 1,200 individuals were seized by or handed to authorities between 2004 and 2006 (COEFA/IBAMA 2008), although this figure is considered to be an underestimate of the true number of Turquoise-fronted Amazons seized and an additional 503 individuals were received by a state wildlife rehabilitation during the same period (ICMBio 2010). In Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, Turquoise-fronted Amazon is the species most frequently rescued by the authorities (Seixas and Mourao 2000); around 6,500 nestlings were seized by the environmental enforcement agencies since 1988 (900 in 2008 alone), and it is estimated that the total number of birds poached from the wild is two-three times higher (Blue-fronted Amazon Project n.d.). According to J. Tella <em>in litt.</em>&#160;(2015), 30,000 birds are captured annually. In Argentina, the National Fauna Authority coordinated the capture of more than 20,000 nestlings and 5,400 adults from the Chaco forest between 1998 and 2012, based on quotas derived from the number of individuals believed to die of natural causes (Berkunsky <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017b). However, a study by&#160;Berkunsky<em> et al.</em> (2017b) found that harvested individuals are generally removed from nests at a later stage than that when much of the natural mortality occurs, meaning that harvested parrots largely do not represent individuals that would otherwise have died of natural causes. A survey of a major illegal wildlife market in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, recorded 1,296 individuals being traded across 2005, 80.7% of which were adult birds (Pires <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>Other potential threats include habitat loss and degradation through selective cutting of <em>Schinopsis</em> trees, overgrazing by domestic livestock, forest clearance by cutting and burning for conversion to pasture and arable agriculture, and oil exploration activities&#160;(Schunk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). A decline in the numbers of fledglings recorded across five communal roosts in the Pantanal from 2004-2009 was attributed to the cutting and burning of woody vegetation&#160;(Seixas and Mourão 2018). A study of land cover change in the Chaco region estimated that 20.7% of the natural area was transformed between 1976 and 2012, largely through conversion to croplands and pasture (Vallejos <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).","This species is described as 'fairly common' (Stotz <em>et al.</em> 1996). A survey of an area of c.2,700 km<sup>2</sup> in the southern Pantanal in Brazil found six large communal roosts, five of which contained an average June-July total of 4,571 individuals, 3.6% of which consisted of fledglings (Seixas and Mourão 2018). Very rough population estimates range from 905,000 - 2,290,000 mature individuals based on the population densities of congeners, the area of the mapped range and assuming only c.10% of the range is occupied. Santini <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2019) estimated a population size of 10,424,783 mature individuals, based on a modelled population density and the area of habitat within the species's extent of occurrence. Scaling up the above estimate of a minimum of 4,406 mature individuals in 2,700 km<sup>2 </sup>to the species's overall range gives a total population size of 9,559,420 mature individuals. The population size is therefore placed in the band 1,000,000 - 10,000,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Amazona aestiva</em> has a large range across <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Paraguay</strong>, <strong>Bolivia</strong> and northern <strong>Argentina</strong>. It is found from Maranhão and Pará in northeast Brazil, west to north and east Bolivia and south to Córdoba, Argentina and&#160;Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Collar <em>et al. </em>2019, WikiAves 2019). In recent years the species has expanded its range into urban centres such as&#160;São Paulo and&#160;Campo Grande, possibly as a result of escapes or releases of captive individuals (Schunk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).

Live capture is illegal in Brazil and in Bolivia (Schunk <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Pires <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), but captive-bred birds may be traded domestically, making trade more difficult to enforce, and incidents of poaching or illegal trafficking often receive little punishment (Ortiz-von Halle 2018). In Argentina, harvesting of individuals has been subject to a quota-based sustainable trade scheme that complied with CITES and invested income into habitat protection (Ortiz-von Halle 2018). However, the scheme ceased following an EU import ban (Ortiz-von Halle 2018). The authorities make considerable efforts to control domestic trade in cities in the Amazon region (Ortiz-von Halle 2018). Individuals confiscated by or handed to the authorities are rehabilitated and many have been released back into the wild (Seixas and Mourao 2000), although there is not always monitoring of the success of such reintroductions (Ortiz-von Halle 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>The Blue-fronted Amazon Project (Projeto Papagaio-Verdadeiro), run by Fundação Neotrópica do Brasil, is monitoring populations and trade in the species, restoring nesting cavities, developing agreements about conservation with state and federal authorities, encouraging people to report incidents of illegal wildlife trade and carrying out an education programme about the species's conservation in the Pantanal, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil (Blue-fronted Amazon Project n.d., Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017a).

As a consequence of the establishment of conservation measures in the 1990s, the species increased slowly from fewer than 50 to over 200 mature individuals. After Hurricane Maria hit Dominica in September 2017, the population plummeted again, likely to an all-time low. The frequency of intense hurricanes is projected to increase, with potentially severe consequences for the species. Imperial Amazon has therefore been uplisted to Critically Endangered. <br/><br/><br/><p></p>","It mainly inhabits montane and elfin forest at 600-1,300 m, but forages down to 150 m in response to food shortages (Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment <em>in litt.</em> 2000, Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. It is highly sensitive to habitat modification, readily abandoning traditional foraging and nesting territories (Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Nests are situated in cavities in tall forest trees (the same species as used by Red-necked Amazon <em>Amazona arausiaca</em>), with breeding between February and June (coinciding with the dry season). The nest cavity is heavily festooned with vines and epiphytes, making observation of nesting activity difficult (Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Despite the intensive work carried out towards this species's conservation, its ecology remains poorly known. <p></p>","The species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation and by direct prosecution. Currently, the most severe among these threats is hurricane damage, which not only leads to vast destruction of habitat, but also to direct mortality of the species. The damage caused by hurricanes can severely degrade the species's habitat. Hurricane Maria destroyed about 30% of the forest cover on Dominica and defoliated a large proportion of the remaining trees (Forestry and Agriculture Department <em>per</em> Palmer <em>et al.</em> 2018). In the aftermath of Maria, most individuals were observed in lowland areas outside of their range (S. Durand <em>per </em>C. Palmer <em>in litt.</em> 2019), indicating that montane forests have not yet fully recovered from the impacts of the hurricane and by now only offer a low quality habitat (C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Hurricanes periodically occur in the Caribbean and therefore&#160;are a  natural feature of the species's habitat, which may cause the species to  undergo cyclical fluctuations (C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019).  However, as the frequency of particularly intense hurricanes in the  Caribbean is projected to increase as a consequence of climate change  (Bender <em>et al</em>. 2010, Knutson <em>et al.</em> 2010), there is a high likelihood that severe storms may hit Dominica before the population has a chance to recover (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019, C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Apart from hurricane-related damage, forested habitat is also lost for conversion to plantations, especially bananas (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). Deforestation may increase the competition for nest-sites with the more numerous Red-necked Amazon <em>Amazona arausiaca</em>, as the two species  come increasingly into contact (Dominica Ministry of Agriculture and the  Environment <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Imperial Amazon is further threatened by trapping. Hunting for food and trapping for the cage-bird trade were among the principal reasons for the species's decline up until the 1990s (P. R. Reillo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Local trade has been considerably reduced, if not eliminated, as a result of a successful education programme, but foreign bird-collectors still pose a threat (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Two individuals rescued after Hurricane Maria were exported to a breeding facility in Germany (Palmer <em>et al.</em> 2018). While issues relating to the ex-situ conservation of this species are  complex and often controversial, the overall number of individuals held in captivity is extremely low (C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Furthermore, as there is no  coordinated captive-breeding programme in place, the potential extirpation of the species in the wild may result in the functional extinction of  the species (C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019).<br/><p></p>","Prior to 2017, when Hurricane Maria hit Dominica, the population was estimated to number 250-350 individuals in total, roughly equivalent to 160-240 mature individuals (P. R. Reillo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Since Maria, the population has not been quantified due to the inaccessibility of the core parts of the range in the interior of the island (C. Palmer<em> in litt</em>. 2019, P. R. Reillo <em>in litt</em>. 2019). However, inferences can be drawn based on the effects of previous hurricanes and on recent sightings of the  species. Maria is considered to be the strongest and possibly most  destructive hurricane that has hit the island so far. Previously, the most  severe storm was Hurricane David in 1979, after which the population of  Imperial Amazon plummeted to only 40-60 individuals (Evans 1991, Palmer <em>et al.</em>  2018). Tentatively assuming that the impact of Maria on the  population was at least as severe as David, the population size may have  decreased to fewer than 40-60 individuals, equating to fewer than about  25-40 mature individuals.This preliminary estimate is  supported by field data, reporting only 11 individuals about half a year  after Hurricane Maria (Palmer <em>et al.</em> 2018). Further sightings have been reported in the northern part of the range in June 2019 (A. Fairbairn <em>per </em>C. Palmer<em> in litt</em>. 2019). To account for the uncertainty surrounding the current population size, until more recent estimates become available the species is here assumed to number &lt; 50 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Amazona imperialis</em> is endemic to <strong>Dominica</strong>, where it inhabits the Morne Diablotin area (primarily on the north-east, south and south-east slopes [Raffaele <em>et al.</em> 1998]<strong></strong>) and the Northern and Central Forest Reserves; it has recently re-established a small population in the Morne Trois Pitons National Park near Morne John (Reillo 2001, P. R. Reillo <em>in litt. </em>2007, Wiley <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. The species is known to have declined significantly in the past, when the population plummeted to an estimated 25-40 mature individuals after Hurricane David in 1979 severely damaged the forests on the island. Conservation action then increased the population to 160-240 mature individuals in 2012 (P. R. Reillo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. Until recently, the species's strongholds used to be in Morne Diablotin National Park and its surroundings, the Central Forest Reserve and the Morne Trois Pitons National Park and surroundings. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017, the population likely declined drastically; importantly, some of the remaining individuals have been observed outside of the original range in the montane forest (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;It is conceivable that the species evaded into lower-quality lowland habitat as a consequence of the hurricane (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2018). By January 2018, preliminary surveys detected 11 Imperial Amazons at nine localities throughout the island, all outside of the original range (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2018). By June 2019, further sightings have been reported within and adjacent to the Morne  Diablotin and Morne Trois Pitons National Parks, Central Forest Reserve,  Northern Forest Reserve and on other sites on privately-owned land (A. Fairbairn <em>per </em>C. Palmer <em>in litt</em>. 2019, P. R. Reillo <em>in litt</em>. 2019).  Most sightings occurred along forest edges and on ridges (P. R. Reillo <em>in litt</em>. 2019).

The population size has been placed in the band of 50-249 mature individuals, and for this reason it is classified as Endangered.","<p>In an attempt to explain widespread but scattered records, the species was previously thought to be nomadic or to have very large home ranges (Higgins 1999). However, limited radio- and GPS-tracking carried out by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2017b) implies that the species is more sedentary than these speculations suggest. Movement of two tracked birds remained within an area of approximately 70 km<sup>2</sup>. Individuals moved approximately 30 km per night within a radius of less than 10 km from roosting locations.<br/>Tracked birds moved from their roosts in <em>Triodia</em>&#160;(spinifex) hummocks to feeding sites in more diverse habitats marked by large-seeded grass and forb species. Physiological modelling suggests that the species may need to visit standing water, especially during summer (Kearney <em>et al. </em>2016). The bird GPS-tracked by Murphy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2017b) only visited a permanent water source once. However, a considerable amount of rain fell during the tracking period, and so ephemeral water sources were likely to be available. During winter, Night Parrots may satisfy water requirements from their diet, which may include succulent plants, such as <em>Sclerolaena </em>spp (Kearney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/>Most habitat records are of <em>Triodia </em>grasslands and/or chenopod shrublands (Garnett <em>et al</em>. 2011) in the arid and semi-arid zones, and Higgins (1999) listed <em>Astrebla </em>spp. (Mitchell grass), shrubby samphire and chenopod associations, scattered trees and shrubs, <em>Acacia aneura</em> (Mulga) woodland, treeless areas and bare gibber as associated with sightings of the species. S. Murphy (pers. comm. in TSSC 2016) recorded a similar range of habitats used or traversed by individuals in southwestern Queensland: Cretaceous sandstone, claystone, and siltstone residuals; either dominated by <em>Triodia longiceps</em> on slopes and margins of duricrust plateaus or with <em>Sclerolaena </em>spp., <em>Maireana </em>spp. (Saltbush spp.), <em>Ptilotus </em>spp. (Mulla Mulla spp.), and small areas of <em>T. longiceps</em>; with occasional watercourses with <em>Acacia cambagei </em>(stinking gidgee).&#160;The habitat of the southwestern Queensland population is naturally fragmented, and is unlikely to promote fire behaviour that results in most habitat in this area being burned by one fire event (Murphy 2015, S. Murphy pers. comm. 2016 in TSSC 2016).<br/>Recent and historical accounts of nests describe a slight depression in a cavity at the end of a tunnel built into a&#160;<em>Triodia</em>&#160;hummock (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2017, Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2017a).

Blyth (1996) proposed a list of threats considered realistic in the absence of direct evidence. Threats to the species are likely to vary across its range and might include predation by feral cats and foxes; soil disturbance, erosion and loss caused by herbivores (including livestock and over-abundant native and feral herbivores);&#160;degradation of habitat around water points by herbivores; competition for food by herbivores; fire;&#160;psittacine beak and feather disease, avian pox, and other diseases;&#160;illegal collection of birds or eggs;&#160;disturbance from bird-watching activities; fences; and reduction in water availability through over-use of waterholes by camels and&#160;reduced waterhole maintenance (TSSC 2016). Biophysical modelling suggests that predicted temperature increases under various climate change scenarios would increase the species's dependence on free-standing water dramatically (Kearney&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). Thus, climate change, interacting with the spatial configuration of water points and habitats, and the concentration of feral predators at water points, may become a serious future threat.<p></p>","The size of the currently known population has not been estimated, but it is assumed that the number of mature individuals is in the band 50-249 (<em>per </em>Garnett <em>et al</em>. 2011), but may prove to be larger.",Decreasing,"<p>This nocturnal parrot is endemic to <strong>Australia</strong>.

The Animals Committee of CITES recommended a two-year ban from January 2007 on exports of <em>timneh </em>from  four West African countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and  Guinea),&#160;and since then all of these countries continue to have zero export quotas recommended by CITES. Guinea-Bissau has not issued any export permits since 2000, however these restrictions have been circumvented and exports of wild-sourced birds have continued under the guise of legal trade (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). For several years Guinea exported significant numbers as ‘Captive-bred’ despite there being no commercial-scale breeding facilities in Guinea (CITES 2012). Additionally, multiple shipments have been made from Mali despite the species not naturally occurring there. In late 2015, a shipment of 89 Timneh Parrots that originated in Mali was confiscated in Dakar&#160;(R. Martin&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). In addition, despite there being no legal avenues for commercial exports of wild-sourced birds, some traders continue to advertise exports of recently obtained birds&#160;(R. Martin&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). The import of wild-caught birds into the EU was  prohibited in 2007, leading to a fall in exports of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. erithacus </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. timneh</span>, but the number of exportations rose once again in 2008 and 2009 (Anon. 2011), and since then exports have been re-oriented to the Middle East (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 2009, Ghana largely ceased legal exports of <em>P. erithacus</em> in the early 1990s, and around that time trappers and traders from Ghana also moved into other countries. As a result there was additional trapping pressure. Since Ghana ceased commercial exports,&#160;<em>P. timneh&#160;</em>range states (and Mali) have exported 122,868 individuals, with Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea each exporting around 46,000 (not all&#160;<em>P. timneh</em>&#160;as some were&#160;<em>P. erithacus</em>) (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Legal trade as monitored by  CITES may represent only a proportion of the total numbers  captured from the wild. <br/>Habitat loss is undoubtedly having significant impacts throughout the range.

However, this is likely to have been an overestimate and the population may now be lower if the species is declining rapidly (R. Martin <em>in litt. </em>2016). Gatter (1997) estimated a significantly higher density of two breeding pairs / km<sup>2</sup> in logged forest north of Zwedru, Liberia, and a recent status assessment for the population in Guinea-Bissau indicates a national population of 250-1000 individuals, with very low population densities (or an absence) everywhere in that country, with the exception of small (&lt;8km<sup>2</sup>) islands remote from permanent human habitation (da Costa Lopes 2014, Martin&#160;<em>et al. in prep.</em>).

These threats have had such a significant impact that the total population is now very small. <p></p>,"It inhabits humid and wet lowland, foothill and (in south-western Ecuador) dry deciduous forest<strong> </strong>(Benítez <em>et al</em>. 2002; Berg <em>et al</em>. 2007), but occurs in edge habitats and crosses open areas<strong> </strong>(Fjeldså <em>et al</em>. 1987; Juniper and Parr 1998). It is found mainly below 600 m, but occurs to 1,000 m and occasionally 1,500 m in Darién. In Costa Rica, it strongly prefers <em>Dipteryx panamensis</em> as principal nesting tree, with 87% of all active nests found on this tree (Macaw Recovery Network 2020); local movements may reflect the asynchronous fruiting of <em>Dipteryx panamensis</em> (Powell <em>et al</em>. 1995; Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. Breeding pairs typically produce 1-2 chicks per breeding season (Macaw Recovery Network 2019). In south-western Ecuador, it breeds in June-November, and nests in cavities of dead <em>Cavanillesia plantanifolia</em> trees (Berg and Horstman 1996; López-Lanús <em>et al</em>. 1999). Orchids made up 71% of the diet of a pair watched in Ecuador, and their feeding range was estimated at 2,000 ha (López-Lanús <em>et al</em>. 1999). In the non-breeding season, it tends to form flocks that disperse over large distances in search of food (O. Chassot verbally 2004; O. Jahn <em>in litt</em>. 2004, 2005)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","In Central America, original vegetation is converted for agriculture, plantations, cattle-ranching and logging<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Stattersfield <em>et al</em>. 1998; S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<em> Dipteryx panamensis</em> is selectively logged in Costa Rica (Powell <em>et al</em>. 1995). Pineapple plantations are rapidly expanding and replacing tropical forest habitat in Costa Rica (S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Annual deforestation rates are high throughout its range (FAO 2001). Deforestation in Panama probably exceeds 30% of its original range<strong> </strong>(G. Angehr <em>in litt</em>. 2005) and in some other countries (e.g., Costa Rica and Ecuador) the historical range was reduced by ~90 % over the past 100 years<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong> (Chassot <em>et al</em>. 2002; O. Jahn <em>in litt</em>. 2004, 2005)<strong></strong>. In its South American range, plans to colonise and develop remoter areas are progressing through infrastructural improvements, particularly the rapid expansion of the road network, which has increased the impact of logging, small-scale agriculture, illegal coca plantations, gold mining, and hunting, which is also affecting some key protected areas (Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund 2001; Álvarez 2002; Benítez <em>et al</em>. 2002). Large areas of western Ecuador are being purchased, denuded of forest and converted to industrial oil palm plantations (Sharpe 1999). Urbanisation and agriculture have largely extirpated race <em>guayaquilensis</em>, and it is reportedly shot as a crop-pest (Pople <em>et al</em>. 1997; Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. There is illegal capture for (mostly internal) trade, food and feathers<strong></strong> (Low 1995; Powell <em>et al</em>. 1995; Sharpe 1999; C. J. Sharpe <em>in litt</em>. 1999; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; Benítez <em>et al</em>. 2002).","The species has a disjunct range and localised distribution. The population in Honduras currently numbers c. 400 individuals (H. O. Portillo Reyes <em>per</em> S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020), which roughly equates to 260 mature individuals. The population in northern Costa Rica and southern Nicaragua numbered less than 200 individuals, equating to c. 130 mature individuals, in 2019 (Macaw Recovery Network 2019). In Ecuador, the species occurs in two disjunct subpopulations, with a total of up to 50-70 individuals, equating to 35-50 mature individuals, in 2020 (M. Moens <em>per</em> S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In 2014, the population in Colombia was estimated at up to 1,700 mature individuals (Botero-Delgadillo and Páez 2011; Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014); however this is now considered an overestimate, with the true population size closer to 100 mature individuals (Fundación ProAves <em>in litt</em>. 2020). For Panama, recent population data is not available (B. Schmitt <em>per</em> S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Based on these national numbers, the global population is now estimated to number  at least 525 mature individuals; to account for uncertainty and an additional population in southern Panama, the global population is here  placed in the band 500-1,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Ara ambiguus</em> occurs as two subspecies. The nominate race occurs from <strong>Honduras</strong> to north-west <strong>Colombia</strong>, and the race <em>guayaquilensis</em> is endemic to western <strong>Ecuador</strong> (Fjeldså <em>et al</em>. 1987). In <strong>Panama</strong>, it is locally fairly common on the Caribbean slope and in Darién near Cana, Alturas de Nique<strong> </strong><strong></strong>(G. Angehr <em>in litt</em>. 1993, 2005; C. J. Sharpe <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011) and adjacent Colombia (P. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999), and occurs in Serranía de Majé and south Cerro Hoya<strong> </strong>(Robbins <em>et al</em>. 1985). In Colombia, it is found in the Nariño and Chocó departments, with the stronghold being the Darién lowlands and Uraba forests east of the río Atrato and Serranía de Baudó (Fundacíon ProAves <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Honduras, it is restricted to the Moskitia region and is now rare near the río Plátano (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; Portillo-Reyes 2018). In <strong>Nicaragua</strong>, it persists in the Bosawas Reserve and the Indio-Maíz and San Juan Reserve (C. J. Sharpe <em>in litt</em>. 1999; O. Chassot verbally 2004)<strong></strong>. The Sarapiqui region in northern <strong>Costa Rica</strong> is one of the last strongholds for the species (S. Williams <em>per </em>S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Ecuador, the majority of the population is found in Esmeraldas and the Cordillera de Chongón-Colonche, Guayas (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000; Benítez 2002).

The stronghold is in Darién Biosphere Reserve, Panama, and adjacent Los Katíos National Park, Colombia. There are important reserves in all range states, but these provide insufficient protection for seasonal wanderers (Juniper and Parr 1998). The Macaw Recovery Network in Costa Rica implements conservation programmes such as species management, habitat protection and restoration, community outreach and behavioural change (S. Nazeri <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Costa Rica, a proposed moratorium on logging <em>D. panamensis</em> has not yet been implemented (Powell <em>et al</em>. 1995; Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. A bi-national campaign in the lowlands of the San Juan River (Nicaragua  and Costa Rica) aims to increase awareness of biology, threats and  conservation, and strengthen management of natural resources (Chassot <em>et al</em>. 2006). A government-backed conservation strategy is being implemented in Ecuador<strong> </strong>(E. Horstman <em>in litt</em>. 2005). In 2007, a successful rapid assessment study in search of the last surviving individuals was carried out in the Cordillera Chongón-Colonche, Ecuador<strong></strong><strong></strong> (O. Jahn <em>in litt</em>. 2004, 2005). Fundación Jocotoco is reintroducing the subspecies <em>guayaquilensis </em>in coastal Chongón-Colonche (M. Moens <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Habitat restoration utilizing native dry tropical forest species that are known or potential macaw food sources is being carried out in the Cerro Blanco Protective Forest, western Ecuador, by the Pro-Forest Foundation, with &gt;250 hectares so far replanted with 35 native species (E. Horstman<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt. </span>2012).

Most birds in the Guianas have been reported from gallery forest<strong></strong> (Wege and Collar 1991), but this may be an artefact of river transport use by observers<strong></strong> (Juniper and Parr 1998). There are some seasonal movements, apparently in response to food availability, from interior to coastal Suriname in July-August<strong></strong><strong></strong> (Wege and Collar 1991<strong></strong>, Juniper and Parr 1998). It occurs up to 1,700 m in Venezuela and 560 m in Guyana<strong></strong> (Wege and Collar 1991). <p></p>","It has probably declined since the 19th century as a result of trapping for trade and habitat loss, particularly in the Gran Sabana region of Bolívar and parts of coastal Guianas<strong></strong> (Wege and Collar 1991). It was internationally traded in small numbers during the 1980s, and this has continued especially in Guyana, where 321 were exported in 2002, and Suriname<strong> </strong>(CITES 2004). Overall, the international pet trade is no longer thought to affect the species (Dickey 2020, O. Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Some internal trade may still continue, perhaps most frequently for food and pets in the far east of its range (Desenne and Strahl 1991, Wege and Collar 1991, O. Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Suriname, the species may be killed accidentally by hunters targeting <em>A. amazonica</em>&#160;(O. Ottema <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Large tracts of forests are still pristine in Suriname, but logging and gold mining are increasingly destroying and degrading remaining habitat (O. Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In the area where the species has been recorded in&#160;Pará, there is significant mining of bauxite on plateaus (de Faria and Gomide Alvim 2013).","The species is described as locally common in French Guiana and Venezuela (Hilty 2003, GEPOG <em>per </em>O.

Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020), though it may be overlooked (O. Ottema <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The population in French Guiana is estimated at 2,000-20,000 individuals (GEPOG <em>per </em>O. Claessens and V. Pelletier <em>in litt</em>. 2020), which may roughly equate to 1,300-13,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Assuming a similar density in Venezuela, the population there may number 500-5,000 mature individuals. Assuming further that the species reaches half the density in Guyana, Suriname and Brazil, the population in these range states may amount to 4,300-43,000 mature individuals. The global population is therefore tentatively placed in the band 6,000-61,000 mature individuals, though this requires confirmation.<br/><br/>Although there is little information about the species's subpopulation structure, the species is monotypic and there is no evidence to suggest that there are distinct subpopulations, so it is assumed that there is only one subpopulation.",Decreasing,"<em>Amazona dufresniana</em> occurs in south-east <strong>Venezuela</strong> (Bolívar, with an isolated record in Amazonas), <strong>Guyana</strong>, north-east <strong>Suriname</strong> and <strong>French Guiana</strong><strong></strong> (Wege and Collar 1991, GEPOG 2020) and northern <strong>Brazil</strong> (de Faria and&#160;Gomide Alvim 2013, Carvalho 2016). The species is widespread and locally common in French Guiana and Venezuela (Hilty 2003, GEPOG 2020). In other parts of the range, the scarcity of records from frequently surveyed areas suggests that this is a low density and rather uncommon species (Wege and Collar 1991).

The population is suspected to be undergoing only a slow decline, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is fairly large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. <p></p>","It inhabits temperate cloud and elfin forest at 2,400-3,400 m, occasionally observed at 1,400-1,800 m<strong>&#160;</strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998, Botero-Delgadillo and Páez 2011b) or as high as 3,600 m (Williamson 2020), in areas characterised by trees in the Melastomataceae and Cunoniaceae (Montes and Verhelst 2011). Some populations are nomadic, possibly owing to a heavy dependence on <em>Podocarpus</em> cones. In Ecuador, it nests in dead <em>Ceroxylon </em>wax palms, even where these trees are scarce (Sornoza Molina and López-Lanus 1999). In Colombia, this species is also known to nest in the trunks of <em>Weinmannia </em>sp. and utilize <em>Tullandsia </em>sp. for obtaining water (Carantón 2004; Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006). Across the Colombian Cordillera Central region, the species was also shown to exhibit preferences towards well-preserved mature forests, although secondary forests were also commonly used (Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006, Botero-Delgadillo and Páez 2011a). The two most important plants for feeding are <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Brunellia</span> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">goudoti </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Podocarpus oleifolius</span> (Montes and Verhelst 2011). Nesting likely corresponds to food availability, and may not be seasonal in many areas (Sornoza Molina and López-Lanus 1999); however, consistent nesting in locations such as Tapichalaca Reserve in southern Ecuador from approximately December through April suggests that this species may nest regularly in some parts of its range (Williamson 2011, Williamson 2016).&#160;<p></p>","Habitat loss and fragmentation was previously considered considerable throughout its range, with 90-93% of montane forest lost in Colombia, but less in Peru (Salaman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999, P.

However, recent evidence suggest that previous forest loss may have been overestimated (Tracewski&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016, Global Forest Watch 2020). The cutting of wax palms for Palm Sunday services is considered a problem in parts of Ecuador, and palms also suffer poor recruitment because cattle browse young trees, with logging in adjacent areas increasing their susceptibility to parasites and disease<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Salaman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999).&#160;In the Loja province of Ecuador, cattle ranching and felling of trees for construction products and fuel has previously led to encroachment of habitats (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). Road construction is on-going throughout many areas of elfin and cloud forest in Peru and has caused severe habitat loss in areas such as Abra Malaga<strong> </strong>(H.

Burning of pasture is additionally known to inhibit plant succession of the primary habitats occupied by this species (Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006). At Tapichalaca Reserve in southern Ecuador, occupation of nest boxes by honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) and predation by snakes and mammals such as <em>Mustela frenata</em>&#160;may pose dangers to both nestlings and adults (Williamson 2011, 2016). Competition between nesting sites by other resident parrot species and predation by large birds of prey such as the Variable hawk (<em>Geranogetus polyosoma</em>) and Black-chested buzzard-eagle (<em>Geranogetus melanoleucus</em>) may also threaten survival of juveniles (Quevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<p></p>","Population density estimates of 2.3-6.6 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> have been recorded in the Cordillera de Chilla region of Ecuador (Jacobs and Walker 1999). This is also consistent with recorded population density estimates for congeners or close relatives with a similar body size, and the fact that only a proportion of the estimated Extent of Occurrence is likely to be occupied. Using the best available information therefore, the overall population of the species is estimated to number 11,000-30,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 7,300-20,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Leptosittaca branickii</em> is widely but locally distributed in <strong>Colombia</strong> (both slopes of the central Andes, the southern base of the east Andes and one record from Cerro Munchique, Cauca, in the west Andes), <strong>Ecuador</strong> (isolated massifs in the far north and south, but only in the south on the main Andean ridges) and <strong>Peru</strong> (Cordillera de Colán and the east Andean slope, with one record on the west slope of the Cordillera Central in La Libertad).

Assuming that 10% of the mapped range is occupied by the species, Scarlet-breasted Lorikeet may therefore number 2,100-37,000 individuals, roughly equating to 1,400-25,000 mature individuals. However, the population is thought to number closer to the lower end of the estimate, and considering the known rarity of the species due to increasing pressure from trapping for trade, the population is suspected to be below 1,500 mature individuals. Thus, population size is tentatively placed here in the band of 500-1,500 mature individuals. It is further considered that the largest population on Sumbawa may not exceed 250 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Trichoglossus forsteni</em> (incorporating <em>mitchelli</em>, <em>djampeanus</em> and <em>stresemanni</em>) was previously found on the islands of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Tanahjampea and Kalaotoa, <strong>Indonesia</strong>. However, recent records show that the species is likely restricted to only parts of Bali (extending into the Banyuwangi region of Java), northern parts of Lombok, and only parts of the West Nusa Tenggara province in Sumbawa (including areas within the vicinity of Mount Tambora; eBird 2020).&#160;On Lombok the species was observed in a flock of 18 above 1,500 m in 2015 (F. Rheindt per Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), though given the lack of other records for many decades it was assumed that the population is likely to be small. Sumbawa was also previously considered the stronghold of the species, and the species was suggested to be ‘secure’ here(Eaton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), with a large area of potentially suitable habitat remaining on the island. However, it is possible that the population here has&#160;always remained rare (since 1993) owed to extensive trapping (Butchart <em>et al</em>. 1996 <em>per </em>Collar 2017). Thus, it is assumed that only a small, highly unstable population is currently present (Prihatmoko&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019,&#160;M. Halaouate <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Numbers at Tatar Sepang have for example reduced significantly, with 200 birds recorded in 1997 down to only 50 birds in 2003, few as 6 in 2016 (M. S. Yusuf <em>in litt</em>. 2017 <em>per&#160;</em>Collar 2017), only 4 were observed in 2018 at Batudulang forest in the Sumbawa Besar Regency, and no records in 2019 (Prihatmoko&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). There are additionally no recent records from the Marente Forest (A. Reuleaux <em>in litt</em>. 2017 <em>per </em>Collar 2017). Confiscated birds were previously released on Nusa Penida, although its presence there is uncertain (S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2020, J.

Where this suggests a small population may have existed in Bali following heavy exploitation which extensively reduced numbers between 1910-1920, it cannot be ruled out that existing individuals may be escaped cage birds finding refuge within the area (Prihatmoko <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>As such, it is estimated that only 50 birds have been recorded away from Sumbawa, Lombok and Bali (J.

Some of this apparent increase may be due to improved survey methods but a genuine increase has also taken place. Nevertheless, the species has a very small range with just two main breeding colonies occupying a very small area, and its caatinga habitat continues to be degraded through clearance for agriculture. The species is therefore listed as Endangered.<p></p> <p></p>","The species occurs in arid <em>caatinga </em>with sandstone cliffs (for colonial nesting and roosting) and stands of licurí palms.

Breeding occurs between February and April. Two young often fledge. <p></p>","The historical decline has been attributed to habitat clearance for agriculture, hunting and trapping (Lima 2007). The main factor currently limiting the population size is believed to be a reduction of food resources, especially licurí (Brandt and Machado 1990,&#160;Lugarini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Habitat is cleared for the subsistence cultivation of maize, beans and cassava and for large-scale livestock grazing (Lugarini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Licurí palm-stands formerly covered 250,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;but have been vastly reduced by livestock-grazing.&#160;Vegetation is cleared through burning, which tends to have little control (Lugarini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). A major fire could now eradicate most of the food supply for the Toca Velha-Serra Branca population. The extraction of firewood and timber also pose threats (IBAMA 2006). In 1992-1995, c.20 birds were caught and sold to smugglers from Toca Velha-Serra Branca (Munn 1995), and in 1996 at least 19 individuals were taken (Reynolds 1997).

The species is known to breed at two colonies at Toca Velha, Canudos, and Serra Branca,&#160;Jeremoabo, south of the Raso da Catarina plateau. In 2013, a nesting site was recorded at&#160;Fazenda Barreiras de Dentro, Canudos (Araujo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Its feeding and roosting areas stretch across the municipalities of Canudos, Jeremoabo, Euclides da Cunha, Paulo Afonso, Sento Sé, Campo Formoso, Monte Santo, Santa Brígida and Novo Triunfo (Sick <em>et al.</em>&#160;1987, Munn 1995, IBAMA 2006, dos Santos Neto and Camandaroba 2007, de Sousa and Barbosa 2008, Araujo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). A small group at Sento Sé/Campo Formoso, discovered in 1995 is now considered to refer to birds from the Toca Velha-Serra Branca population following patches of fruiting licurí <em>Syagrus </em>palms<strong> </strong>(Munn 1995, C.

It is also persecuted as a crop-pest, hunted for food and trapped for the local and formerly at least, international cage-bird trade (Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. Trapping of adults and robbing nests for chicks to supply the local pet trade is a particular concern because in some areas most families own a parrot, and these only live a few years before they have to be replaced (G.

Conservation action has increased the population since 1975, but it remains Critically Endangered because the number of mature individuals remains tiny. Hurricanes Irma and Maria had significant detrimental impacts on the ongoing population recovery and trends are currently uncertain. If the remaining population and future released birds continue to breed in the wild and numbers remain stable or increase, the species may warrant downlisting in the future.<p></p> <p></p>","Historically, the species occurred in montane and lowland forest and mangroves. It is now restricted to forest at elevations of 200-600 m. It breeds between late February and July, when it nests in large, deep tree-cavities and lays 3-4 eggs (Raffaele <em>et al.</em> 1998; Arendt 2000)<strong></strong>. Since 2001, all known nesting in the wild has occurred in artificial cavities (White <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2006) until in 2013, the first natural nest in 42 years was recorded in Río Abajo (V. Anadon <em>in litt. </em>2013; Coto 2013).<strong></strong><p></p>","Suitable forested habitat for this species has almost entirely been lost. Hunting for food, pest control and the cage-bird trade have had crippling effects in the past (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The principal threats are now competition for nest-sites, loss of young to parasitic botflies, predation and natural disasters such as hurricanes (Raffaele <em>et al.</em> 1998; Arendt 2000)<strong></strong>. Red-tailed Hawks <em>Buteo jamaicensis</em> predate parrots and hamper releases of captive-bred individuals. Predator-aversion training prior to release has improved the survival of captive-reared birds after release into the wild (White <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2005)<strong></strong>; nevertheless raptor predation claimed 21% of all released individuals between 2000 and 2002 and is considered to have removed one of the two remaining individuals from the now absent El Yunque National Park population (M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019). The species formerly suffered from competition for nesting cavities with Pearly-eyed Thrasher <em>Margarops fuscatus</em>, but this has been significantly reduced by specially designed artificial nesting cavities (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Predation by alien invasive mammals is also having a serious impact upon productivity, with six fledglings taken by Small Indian Mongooses <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em> and one nest failure from Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> during 2000-2003 (Engeman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2006); the Luquillo Forest of El Yunque has the amongst the highest Black Rat densities of any site studied globally (J. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Although predation events have not been documented, feral cats <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Felis catus, which </span>are well-documented around the world as devastating bird predators, are also common in parrot habitat in El Yunque National Forest, and represent another threat from an invasive mammal. Parrots regularly disappear without identification of a cause, while cats and mongooses are capable of inflicting unidentifiable losses (R. M. Engeman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The Puerto Rican Boa comprises an additional potential nest predator (J. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2019). It has been suggested that hurricanes are the most serious limiting factor preventing population recovery, and climate change may cause the frequency of hurricane events to increase<strong></strong>. Such devastating hurricane impacts are apparent in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria with the wild population of <em>Amazona vittata</em>&#160;no longer present in El Yunque (M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019). Furthermore, rainfall hampers the recovery programme, as chicks that fledge either during or before a major rainfall event have a much higher mortality rate than chicks that fledge during drier periods (Breining 2009)<strong></strong>.<p></p>","As of 2011, the population numbered c.50-70 individuals spread over two areas, roughly equivalent to 33-47 mature individuals. In 2013, this had increased to c.80-100 individuals in the wild (64-84 at Río Abajo and 15-20 at El Yunque). However, f<span lang=""EN-NZ""><span lang=""EN-NZ"">ollowing Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 large areas of habitat were destroyed and the impact on the species's population remains uncertain. The&#160;population at El Yunque has not yet been found in its former range, and 17 out of 22 individuals that had recently been released with transmitters have been found dead (Paravisini-Gebert 2018); there are not currently believed to be any birds in the wild in this region.&#160;The Río Abajo population has fared much better and persisted successfully despite the hurricanes' impacts, comprising 126-139 individuals by the end of 2019 (M. Lopez-Flores <em>in litt</em>. 2019). The e<span lang=""EN-NZ"">ntire Río&#160;Abajo population however is derived from released birds, which are not counted as mature individuals until they have bred successfully in the wild (IUCN 2011). Successful breeding has been recorded, including post-Hurricane Maria (Gilardi 2018), and the size and range of the flock has been witnessed to be increasing however,&#160;due to the late age of first breeding in this species, it is likely that the majority of the population still comprises introduced individuals (Breining 2009; Valentin 2009; T.

As a result,&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">the total number of mature individuals remains uncertain and is tentatively assumed to remain below 50 due to the large proportion of reintroduced individuals and severe impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.</span></span>",Increasing,"This species&#160;is endemic to <strong>Puerto Rico (to U.S.A.)</strong>, and once occurred throughout the forested parts of the island. An endemic subspecies <span style=""font-style: italic;"">gracilipes</span> occurred on Culebra, but became extinct in 1912. Once abundant, there has been a drastic decline, which reduced the population to c.2,000 by the 1930s and an all-time low of 13 birds in 1975. It has been confined to the Luquillo Mts (El Yunque National Forest) since the 1960s, and the present occupied range of 16 km<sup>2</sup> represents only 0.2% of its former distribution (Snyder<em> et al.</em> 1987)<strong></strong>. Conservation action has prevented the species's extinction, although recovery has been slow and the population remains tiny. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo cut the wild population from 47 to about 23. By the beginning of 1992, there were a minimum of 22-23 parrots in the wild and 58 in captivity, with a record fledging success in July 1992 taking the wild total to 39 or 40 individuals. In 2000, the population numbered 40 wild birds, plus 10 recently re-introduced birds and 100 in captivity, held in two aviaries (Davis 2000; T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>.  In 2001, thieves broke into an aviary and stole a number of captive adults.&#160;In 2004, the wild population numbered 30-35 individuals (Arendt 2000). In 2006, 20 birds were released in the Río Abajo State Forest marking the beginning of a second population in the wild (Velez-Valentin and Boyd 2006)<strong></strong>. A further 26 birds were released here in December 2007 and 19 more in December 2008, with the first two successful nests recorded in the wild at Río Abajo in 2008 (T. White <em>in litt. </em>2005, 2008, 2012)<strong></strong>. As of 2011, the population numbered c.50-70 wild individuals spread over two areas, and about 280 captive individuals (Breining 2009; T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. In 2013, there were 64-84 adults and 16 chicks at Río Abajo and a further 15-20 individuals at El Yunque. In that year, the first natural nest in 42 years was recorded in Río Abajo (V. Anadon <em>in litt. </em>2013; Coto 2013). 400 individuals were recorded in captivity in 2013 (Coto 2013), including a record 107 chicks produced in captivity (Anon. 2013a). In the same year, at least three captive-bred birds were released in the Río Abajo Forest and were subsequently found to be flocking with approximately 150 Orange-winged Amazons <em>Amazona amazonica</em>&#160;away from the original release site (Anon. 2013b). In May 2014, two young birds were discovered in a natural nesting hole outside the boundary of a national park (Anon. 2014b). The impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which hit the island in 2017, on the species are not yet fully known, but the population at El Yunque is no longer known from its natural range and it is considered that there are no longer any wild individuals in the region; 300 individuals persist within the Iguaca aviary however (Paravisini-Gebert 2018; M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019). The population at Río Abajo however, persists and alongside the 212 individuals held within the aviary, a population of 126-139 wild individuals are thought to be inhabit the region's forests (Milpacher 2017; M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. A recovery programme for the species has involved a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service and the World Wide Fund for Nature in conjunction with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (White <em>et al</em>. 2012). Major intervention to preserve the species began in 1968, involving provision of highly successful artificial nest sites, control of nest predators and competitors, and captive breeding and reintroduction. The success of newly fledged parrots is monitored using radio telemetry (Meyers 1996)<strong></strong>. <br/>All remaining habitat is protected in the El Yunque National Forest (formerly the Caribbean National Forest) (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000) and the Río Abajo Commonwealth Forest (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. The population is monitored to help inform management decisions.<br/>Controlling exotic mammalian predators (trapping and toxic baiting) has been shown to be a highly cost-effective way of conserving the species (Engeman <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>2003,&#160;2006; R. M. Engeman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. Trapping data has found the Luquillo Forest to have among the highest Black Rat densities studied in the world, and optimal rat baiting strategies have been devised for application during nesting. Economic analyses based on empirical production costs for captive-bred parrots showed very high benefit-cost ratios for predator management, estimating that the prevention of one parrot loss every 4–12 years more than offsets all forms of predator management (for all species) in the intervening time (Engeman<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2003).<br/>There are two captive-breeding centres, one at El Yunque, which was first established in 1973 with a new facility constructed in 2007, and one at Río Abajo, constructed in 1989 with the first birds transferred from El Yunque to Río Abajo in 1993 (White <em>et al</em>. 2012). 300 birds are currently held at El Yunque with a further 212 individuals held at the Río Abajo aviary (M. Lopez-Flores <em>in litt</em>. 2019). The captive birds are being managed to preserve as much genetic diversity as possible. A release technique known as ""precision release"" was trialled with six birds in 2008. This involves releasing a small number of captive-reared subadult parrots at each active nest site immediately following the fledging of the chicks, and aims to promote immediate and close interaction between the wild parrots and released birds (T. White <em>in litt. </em>2005, 2008)<strong></strong>. Nearly 100 birds have been released from the Río Abajo aviary in an attempt to establish a second population, which may be aided by lower annual rainfall at the site, lower levels of predation and a change in management techniques (T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Although post-release mortality remains high, successful breeding has been recorded, including post-Hurricane Maria (Gilardi 2018),&#160;and the size and range of the flock is increasing (Breining 2009; Valentin 2009; T. White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. The newly establishing population at Río Abajo is located around the site of the Río Abajo aviary; it is thought that the presence of the captive birds has encouraged the released birds to establish their population nearby (White <em>et al</em>. 2012). Forty&#160;individuals were released at El Yunque between 2000 and 2004, eight in 2008 and six birds in 2010 (Vélez-Valentín 2011); a further 30-35 birds were planned for release in January 2020 (M. Lopez-Flores&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2019). In 2013, plans were made to establish a third population on the island in the Maricao State Forest (western Puerto Rico) (Anon. 2014a).<br/>Following Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, parrots persist in the Río Abajo forest, but staff are providing supplementary food and providing shaded areas as much of the canopy has been destroyed (Milpacher 2017).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to monitor population trends and establish the overall population trajectory following Hurricanes Irma and Maria (2017).

However, semi-deciduous forest along more humid valleys at from sea level 1,000 m is optimal breeding habitat (Renton and Salinas-Melgoza 1999, Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al</em>. 2009)<strong></strong>, and provides key food resources during the dry season (Renton 2001)<strong></strong>. A low tolerance to human disturbance is evident as the species is encountered more frequently in conserved than in degraded woodland (Renton and Iñigo-Elias 2003), and prefers conserved semi-deciduous woodland (Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Seasonality plays an important role in the species's life history, influencing diet, habitat use, daily activity, and movements with the species undertaking altitudinal and latitudinal migrations (Renton 2001, Renton and Salinas-Melgoza&#160;2002, Salinas-Melgoza and Renton 2005,&#160;Sánchez-Barradas <em>et al</em>. 2017). The species shows a low rate of reproduction (Renton and Salinas-Melgoza 2004). In Michoacán, nest sites were located preponderantly in relatively inaccessible rugged mountainous terrain, where the large stands of tropical semideciduous forests remain on steep slopes with an average gradient of 22° (Ortega-Rodríguez and Monterrubio-Rico 2008).&#160;<br/><p></p>","Capture for domestic and international trade is the major threat to wild populations. The species is highly valued in trade (Cantú&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007) and was the most captured Amazon parrot species in the early 1980’s (Iñigo-Elias and Ramos 1991). From 1998-2008, 860 <em>Amazona finschi</em>&#160;were legally captured (J. C. Cantú <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Illegal trade is intensive and widespread, and&#160;<em>Amazona finschi</em>&#160;is one of the most frequently confiscated Mexican parrots (K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;It was the sixth most confiscated parrot in Mexico from 1995-2005 and the third most confiscated Mexican parrot in the USA from 1992-2005 (Cantú <em>et al</em>. 2007). During 1981-2001, 4,061 individuals were recorded as traded internationally, of which 79% were exported directly from Mexico and 64% were taken from the wild (CITES 2004a)<strong></strong>.&#160;Captive breeding of parrots was promoted by Mexican environmental authorities to help in conservation but only 154<em> A. finschi’s</em> were bred from 2002-2008 and it didn’t help stop illegal trade (Cantú in press 2020). It remains one of the top five most-captured Mexican parrot species, with an estimated 5,000 individuals/year captured illegally in Mexico (Cantú&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). It is one of the most illegally sold parrot species on the internet (J. C. Cantú, per. obs.). Adults and juveniles are easily netted in large numbers because of their habit of congregating at communal roost sites late in the afternoon (Renton 2005, K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>. Chicks are commonly poached from nests (K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>. During interviews with local people throughout the species's range, 75% reported poaching in their area (K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>. In addition, this species is reported to require semi-deciduous forest with tall, mature trees for nesting, and may not adapt to nesting in modified areas (see Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Marin-Togo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Habitat loss and degradation, mostly for conversion to both small-holder and large-scale cultivation and pasture are serious threats (K. Renton<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007, A. Salinas<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007, Ortega-Rodríguez and Monterrubio-Rico 2008). Semi-deciduous forest along the Pacific coast is being lost at a greater rate than any other forest type in Mexico (Masera&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996, K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>, resulting in the destruction of nest sites and reduction in the extent of this crucial breeding habitat (Renton 2005)<strong></strong>. In Michoacán, the more easily accessible potential nesting areas, such as plains or rolling hills, have now been converted to extensive cattle ranching or agriculture (Ortega-Rodríguez and Monterrubio-Rico 2008). Large development projects, such as dams, have also resulted in loss of breeding habitat for the species (K. Renton<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Semi-deciduous forest now covers only 3,847 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;or 6.6% of the species's current known distribution (Marin-Togo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Despite the various pressures on habitats, Marin-Togo <em>et al</em>. (2012) determined that <em>Amazona finshi</em>&#160;has disappeared from more than 70% of its estimated former range and that primary habitat comprises more than half the area of absence for this species (60.7%), which reinforces the view that trapping pressure is the predominant threat to the species. Nevertheless,&#160;the endemic <em>Amazona finschi</em> faces new threats associated with global change through increased habitat loss and climate change. The increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes making landfall along the Pacific coast has indirect cascading effects on parrot reproduction through the loss of nest-sites and reduction in food resources (Renton <em>et al</em>. 2018). While reproductive output of <em>Amazona finschi</em> recovered following landfall by a minor hurricane (Renton <em>et al</em>. 2018), landfall by the major Hurricane Patricia in 2015 resulted in the loss of 61.5% of nest-sites, and reduced reproductive output by nesting parrots, among the lowest recorded for the species, which has yet to recover 4 years after hurricane landfall (K. Renton unpubl. data).<p></p>","Renton and Iñigo-Elias (2003) estimate the global population at 7,000-10,000 individuals, based on surveys covering the majority of the species's global range. This roughly equates to 4,700-6,700 mature individuals. An estimate that 5,000 individuals each year were captured illegally in Mexico (Cantú&#160;<em>et  al</em>. 2007), implies that the population estimate by Renton and Iñigo-Elias (2003) could be an underestimate, but this is retained in this assessment until better data are available.",Decreasing,"<em>Amazona finschi</em> is endemic to the Pacific coast of <strong>Mexico</strong><sup> </sup>(Forshaw 1989, Collar 1997, Juniper and Parr 1998). Historically, its range extended from southern Sonora and south-western Chihuahua to Oaxaca (Forshaw 1989, Howell and Webb 1995)<strong></strong>.  The species has been practically extirpated from Oaxaca, as well as parts of Nayarit, Jalisco, Durango, Colima and Michoacán, and has undergone significant population declines in many areas of its original range, especially in the lowlands (Renton and Elias 2003)<strong></strong>. Despite local declines the species is most abundant in the states of Jalisco, Michoacán and Sinaloa (Renton and Iñigo-Elias 2003)<strong></strong>. A recent survey, carried out in appropriate habitat in 53 out of 77 50x50 km squares covering the species's entire range, estimated its population size to be 7,000-10,000 individuals (Renton and Iñigo-Elias 2003)<strong></strong>.  The species has disappeared from 37% of the localities where it was historically recorded (Renton and Iñigo-Elias 2003, K. Renton <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, and has shown a decline of 29% in its original distribution over the last 20 years (CITES 2004b)<strong></strong>. It is suspected to be in very rapid decline based on its disappearance from over 70% of its estimated former range (Marin-Togo <em>et al</em>. 2012).<em> <p></p></em>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>In 1999, the Mexican government established a Plan for the Conservation, Protection and Recuperation of Psittacines in Mexico, within which&#160;<em>A. finschi</em>&#160;is considered a priority species (Macias Caballero&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>. In 2004, the species was upgraded to CITES Appendix 1, and in 2007, a proposal was approved for the species to be upgraded in 2008 from 'Threatened' to 'Endangered' under Mexican wildlife law (K. Renton<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007). In Mexico, considerable efforts have been made to tackle illegal national trade, with at least 52 seizures during 1997-2003 (CITES 2004b). Inspections in Mexico resulted in the seizure of 266 live individuals of the species being offered illegally in the pet trade from 1995 to 2003 (CITES 2004b), and in 2008, the Mexican government introduced a ban on the trade of all native parrot species in the country (Cantú and Sánchez, 2011a, K. Renton&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). A decline in seizures of <em>A. finschi</em> occurred after the 2008 ban (J. C.

The population is now so small that lower, but significant, rates of decline are likely in the future. <p></p>","It inhabits dense thorn-forest, savanna, tall deciduous forest and humid riverine woodland, occasionally up to 500 m (with a report of up to 1,377 m at Totula, Veracruz, Mexico [Monterrubio-Rico 2013]). Birds favour semi-arid regions in the northern Atlantic lowlands, but more humid savannas further south. In Belize, it inhabits pine savannas and adjacent evergreen forest patches, and ""<em>guatemalensis</em>"" occurs in coastal scrub, palm savanna and mangroves (Lousada and Howell 1996, Eisermann 2003). Food privation and fire cause occasional wanderings. Breeding typically occurs in February-June, although it occurs earlier in the&#160;Michoacán region between January-May, in the snags of&#160;<em>Roystonea</em>&#160;palms or in nests in tree cavities (Eisermann 2003). The species exhibits a narrow niche breadth for nest-trees, utilising just 11 species with 81% of nests found in&#160;<em>Astronium graveolens</em>, <em>Brosimum alicastrum</em>, and <em>Enterolobium cyclocarpum</em>; nests are typically built&#160;1439 m ± 995 from human settlement with 62% at distances &gt;1 km (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al</em>. 2014; Téllez-García 2008). Nesting success is only 0.5 fledglings per nest (E. C. Enkerlin-Hoeflich <em>in litt</em>. 1994). The species consumes seeds from the forest's semi-deciduous species, such as&#160;<em>Astronium graveolens</em>, <em>Crataeva tapia</em>, and <em>Sideroxylon capiri</em>, as well as fruit from&#160;<em>Ficus insípida</em>&#160;and other tropical dry deciduous forest species (Renton 2002, Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).<p></p>","Habitat loss has been extensive, with 77.4% of primary habitat within the species's potential historical distribution and 80% of the Tamaulipas lowlands cleared for agriculture and pasture, and increasing settlement along the Western Highway in Belize (Somerville 1997, Monterrubio <em>et al. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. Forest loss throughout the species's full range remains extreme, totaling ~22.5% across three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Belize, where much of the suitable habitat lies outside the national protected area system, the regions occupied by the species remain under heavy pressure from development and illegal fires (B. Miller <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Palm savannahs at the only known breeding site in Guatemala are used for non-intensive cattle-grazing (Eisermann 2003), which continues to be a threat here (Fundary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). <br/><br/>Many thousands of individuals of this species are illegally exported from Mexico and some from Belize each year, and it is popular in domestic markets (Low 1995,&#160;Miller and Miller 1997, Somerville 1997). Illegal domestic traffic is intense in Mexico and may account for 38% of the species's recent distributional loss (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. In the Mexican states of Michoacan, Guerrero and Oaxaca, it is mainly nestlings that are taken for the pet trade (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. in litt. </em>2007), with 76% of 13 active nests monitored in 2012 being poached (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Guatemala, it is reported that local military authorities are complicit in the illegal trade of this species, and nest poachers are reported to frequent the species's nesting site (Eisermann 2003, K. Eisermann <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In addition, hunting for food by local fishermen has been reported from Guatemala (Eisermann 2003, K. Eisermann <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In Belize, it is hunted and persecuted for damaging crops (S. N. G. Howell <em>in litt</em>. 1998)<strong></strong> and is still a victim of the illicit pet trade, capture for which involves the cutting down of nesting trees (B. Miller <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Its range around coastal Michoacán is estimated to have declined by 1,507 km<sup>2</sup>, of which 576 km<sup>2</sup> can not be attributed to habitat loss and thus may be due to poaching for trade (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al.</em> 2007). <br/><br/>Additional threats to isolated populations of the species may occur from the increased impact of high intensity hurricanes. In October 2018, the category 3 Hurricane Willa passed directly over the Islas Marias on the Pacific coast of Nayarit, which maintains the island endemic subspecies of <em>Amazona oratrix tresmariae</em>. It is unknown how this endemic population may have been affected by the hurricane impact.<p></p>","The population was estimated at 7,000 individuals in 1994. This is roughly equivalent to 4,700 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Amazona oratrix</em> has undergone a dramatic population decline, judged at 90% since the mid-1970s, to 7,000 birds in 1994. There are three subpopulations in <strong>Mexico</strong>: the nominate race from Jalisco to Oaxaca (Roberson and Carratello 1997); race <em>magna </em>(now considered to be part of the nominate [del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>2017]) in Tamaulipas (in 13 municipalities [T.

On the coast of Michoacán, Mexico, it has been calculated that the species occupies 45.6% of its estimated historic distribution (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al.</em> 2007), yet only 39% (3,432 km<sup>2</sup>) of this occupied range was modelled to constitute suitable habitat conditions for the species, and just 6.6% (587 km<sup>2</sup>) comprised its preferred tropical semi-deciduous forest habitat (Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, 2016).&#160;<em>Amazona oratrix</em>&#160;abundance was evidenced to be 6 times greater in areas of preserved forest rather than in the fragmented, human-disturbed, and intensively cattle ranched areas of the region (Monterrubio-Rico&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Based on intensive field surveys during 2001-2007, it was verified that the species's range has contracted in Colima state, and it has been extirpated in 11 municipalities in coastal Guerrero state (from Tecpan de Galeana to Marquelia) (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. The combined range decline for Colima, Michoacan and Guerrero is estimated at 3,990 km<sup>2<strong>&#160;</strong></sup> (T. Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. The population at Punta de Manabique declined by 30% to 70 individuals from 1994 to 2001 primarily because of nest poaching (Eisermann 2003<em>, </em>K.

Climate change may also affect this species, as with a shift towards a drier environment may have a negative effect on breeding performance (Ortiz-Maciel <em>et al. </em>2014), and could lead to the complete disappearance of this species's currently occupied habitat by 2090 (Monterrubio-Rico <em>et al. </em>2015). The species is affected by some trapping and shooting (Ortiz-Maciel <em>et al.</em> 2006, Valdés-Peña and Ortiz Maciel 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and may experience years of low breeding success (Ortiz-Maciel <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2014)<strong><sup></sup></strong> or even zero recruitment (R.

Pedraza <em>in litt</em>. 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, suggesting wanderers reach the south of the Sierra Madre Oriental. By 1998, 21 colonies had been identified (Snyder and Enkerlin 1996, Macias Caballero 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, with 23 known by 2006 (Ortiz-Maciel <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, but it is still unclear whether it breeds c.25 km south of that range at Cerro Potosí. Counts of large wintering aggregations and productivity data from 1996 to 2007 suggest that the known colonies could account for almost the entire breeding population (R. Valdés-Peña <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, 2010)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. There are four main colonies (El Taray, El Condominio, San Antonio de la Osamenta and Santa Cruz [Macias Caballero 1998]<strong><sup></sup></strong>, with El Taray the most important [Valdés-Peña and Ortiz Maciel 2007]<strong><sup></sup></strong>). Population estimates are hampered by its seasonal movements, but numbers were put at 2,500-3,000 individuals in 1996 (Macias Caballero 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and c.2,500 individuals following surveys in 2006-2007 (R. Valdés-Peña <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, 2010)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. An estimate of c.3,500 individuals was put forward in 2008 (Valdés-Peña <em>et al</em>. 2008)<strong><sup></sup></strong>; however, given that the species is thought to reach reproductive maturity at around four years, there are probably fewer than 2,500 mature individuals (R. Valdés-Peña <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, 2010)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Comparisons with the 1,400 and 1,600 birds estimated in the 1970s indicate that population levels were relatively stable up until the mid-1990s (Snyder and Enkerlin 1996, Macias Caballero 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. However, numbers of breeding pairs at known colonies have been declining, there is poor breeding success and the species's habitat is being destroyed (R.

It has therefore been classified as Near Threatened.","It is widespread in wooded hills, mountain slopes, scrub, cultivation and gardens in humid or semi-arid areas from sea-level to mid-elevation forest (Haynes-Sutton <em>et al. </em>2009). The species feeds on the buds and fruit of many trees and on crop species, and has been regarded as a pest (del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1997, Haynes-Sutton<em> et al.</em> 2009). It breeds in March (Juniper and Parr 1998). The species is commonest at middle elevations (below 1,000 m) and absent from the very wet John Crow Mountains and also from montane forest, although occasionally it occurs in wooded cultivation in the Blue Mountains (Lack 1976, C. Levy and S. Koenig <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The species has been reported to nest only in arboreal termite nests, which must be supported by medium-to-large trees (C. Levy and S. Koenig <em>in litt</em>. 2014).","Despite legal protection, small-scale poaching for the local pet trade and hunting of parakeets for both food and as crop pests continues. Enforcement is weak and many members of the public remain uninformed that killing a bird with a catapult (slingshot) is defined as ""hunting"" (i.e., ""hunting"" is typically viewed as killing gamebirds with a shotgun), and, consequently, illegal. Environmental education campaigns focus on the two larger, more charismatic endemic <em>Amazona </em>parrots (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014). <br/>Habitat loss and fragmentation are perhaps the greatest on-going threats, particularly the conversion of coastal habitats for hotel, residential and commercial development, although deforestation rates are not high (estimated at ~2.75% across three generations [Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016]). Foraging behaviour is poorly-known, and use of the landscape in search of seasonally-available food resources is not understood (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014).<br/>As a frugivore, the species is susceptible to starvation following extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. Compounding the short-term loss of food from the forest canopy, hungry parakeets have been observed feeding on fruits blown to the ground during a hurricane; this behaviour may render them more vulnerable to predation by invasive alien predators, such as mongoose (<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>) and cats (<em>Felis catus</em>), or to persecution by humans. Additionally, temporary loss of natural food resources may make them more prone to attack any crops which escaped the ravages of strong winds and rain; this also will lead to persecution by farmers. <br/>The number of suitable termite nests may be a limiting factor of parakeet reproductive performance (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014), while the importation and escape into the wild of alien psittacines is a further potential threat. Invasive alien psittacines pose threats via the introduction of harmful pathogens (e.g. Psittacine Circovirus / Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease) and parasites, competition for food resources, and, depending upon the species, may compete for nesting substrates (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014). At least one alien species of parakeet (<em>Psittacula krameri</em>) has become established in Jamaica, occurring in Kingston/St. Andrew, where it is expanding in number (C. Levy and S. Koenig<em> in litt.</em> 2014).","A preliminary population estimate is that the population could approach as few as 10,000 mature individuals, placed here in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Eupsittula nana</em> is endemic to the island of <strong>Jamaica</strong>, where it is commonest in mid-elevation wet limestone forest and does not occur in the wet John Crow range in the east.",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and research actions underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.

Its future ought to be secured by the large number of national parks in which it occurs, but many of these currently provide ineffective protection and much of the species's range, at least in Mexico, falls outside the protected area network.<p></p> <p></p>","In South America it inhabits humid lowland forest and adjacent cleared areas, wooded foothills and canyons. In Mexico, it is found in arid and semi-arid woodland, and pine-oak, humid lowland and riparian forest, moving seasonally to dense thorn-forest <strong> </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998,<strong> </strong>Renton 2004)<strong></strong>, although in Puno, Peru it was found to be more abundant in a mosaic of shade coffee plantations and degraded remnant forest patches than in neighbouring pristine Yungas forest<strong> </strong>(S. K. Herzog <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In Mexico it has also been reported to use agricultural fields and orchards (E. R. Rodríguez-Ruíz and A. Banda <em>in litt</em>. 2016). It occurs from sea-level to 3,600 m (E. R. Rodríguez-Ruíz and A. Banda in litt. 2016), but the core range is 500-1,500 m<strong> </strong>(Juniper and Parr 1998)<strong></strong>. Nests and large communal roosts are sited on cliff-faces or in large trees<strong> </strong>(Howell and Webb 1995a<strong>, </strong>Juniper and Parr 1998, Cruz-Nieto <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;In Jalisco and Nayarit on the Pacific coast of Mexico, the species nests in tree cavities located high above the ground in tall emergent trees of <em>Enterolobium cyclocarpum</em>&#160;(de la Parra-Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys of cavity availability found a low density of cavities with characteristics suitable for nesting by Military Macaws, and these were concentrated in semi-deciduous forest (de la Parra-Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Mexico the breeding season begins in January when pairs form, with nesting taking place in May, June and July (E. R. Rodríguez-Ruíz and A. Banda <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<br/><strong></strong><br/><p></p>","Habitat loss and especially domestic trade are the chief threats, even within reserves (Snyder <em>et al</em>. 2000). In 1991-1995, 96 wild-caught specimens were found in international trade, with Bolivia and Mexico possibly the most significant exporters<strong> </strong>(Chebez 1994,<strong> </strong>D. Brightsmith <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. In Mexico, it is still one of the most sought-after species in the illegal cagebird trade; in 1995-2005, it was the fifth most seized Mexican Psittacine species by the country's Environmental Enforcement Agency, becoming the fourth most seized Psittacine species in 2007-2010 (J. C. Cantú <em>in litt</em>. 2010). In many areas it nests in relatively inaccessible cavities on cliff walls, which provides some protection against the pressures of nest poaching (E. R. Rodríguez-Ruíz and A. Banda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). However, nest poaching is a severe threat in Jalisco and Nayarit where the species nests in tree cavities (C. Bonilla <em>in litt. </em>2007, K. Renton <em>in litt. </em>2007).&#160;Furthermore, the dependence on nest-cavities in tall emergent trees means there is limited availability of suitable nest sites for Military Macaws (de la Parra-Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2015), and these are vulnerable to forestry practices that extract large valuable-wood trees (K. Renton <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Jalisco, Mexico, macaws were not found in deforested areas, even where abundant <em>Hura polyandra</em> (an important food source) were left as shade for cattle<strong> </strong>(Renton 2004). GARP analysis estimates that the species has suffered 23% habitat loss within its range in Mexico<strong> </strong>(Ríos Muñoz 2002) and currently, forest loss throughout the species's full range is estimated at ~13% per three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;As the species feeds on agricultural land (crops include corn, walnuts and olives) it may also be threatened by persecution (E. R. Rodríguez-Ruíz and A. Banda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Gold mining operations in Mexico, particularly in the Balsas Region, also pose a threat owing to the associated deforestation and pollution (A. Siguenza and L. Vasquez Reyes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Jaumave, Tamaulipas, Mexican gray squirrels (<em>Sciurus aureogaster</em>) may compete for food with the species&#160;(E R. Rodríguez-Ruíz and A. Banda&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;One sub-population in the Cauca valley, Colombia, numbering fewer than 50 mature individuals, may shortly be lost as a dam is expected to flood the sole nesting cliff (Fundación ProAves 2011).&#160;<p></p>","The population size was preliminarily estimated to fall into the band 10,000-19,999 individuals, equating to 6,667-13,333 mature individuals. However more recent estimates suggest the population is now smaller than previously thought. With one estimate of 1,000-2,000 breeding pairs across the species's range (C. Bonilla <em>in litt</em>. 2016) and another of a total of 5,000-10,000 individuals (G. Marateo, P. Grilli, M. Juarez and I. Berkunsky <em>in litt</em>. 2016).

In particular, habitat loss caused a lack of nest site availability, as dead wax palms were cut for use as durable fence posts and live palms were logged for Palm Sunday processions, decimating once abundant palm groves (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Wax palms are very long-lived and slow-growing (mature individuals are over 500 years old)<strong> </strong>(Salaman 2001); they suffer poor recruitment  because cattle browse young trees, and logging in adjacent areas  increases their susceptibility to disease (Krabbe 1998<strong></strong>, Salaman <em>et al</em>. 1999a, b, P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>. Hunting is a further threat, as the species is easily approachable and largely oblivious to humans (Salaman <em>et al</em>. 2019, P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). In Ecuador, hunting for food was prolific<strong> </strong> (Krabbe and Sornoza 1996, Salaman <em>et al</em>. 1999b)<strong></strong>, and trapping has had some impact in Colombia, although the species is notoriously hard to keep in captivity<strong> </strong>(Salaman <em>et al</em>. 1999b, Salaman 2001<strong></strong>)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><strong></strong>.

Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I and II. The spectacular recovery of the species is the result of an intensive two-decade multifaceted conservation effort by Fundación ProAves, supported by Fundación Loro Parque (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019, Fundación ProAves <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Results from habitat protection and restoration, provision of artificial nest sites, community outreach efforts, a national Palm Sunday campaign (“Reconcile with Nature”) to protect wax palm, community workshops, and among other activities immediately alleviated threats and a population recovery started (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Awareness campaigns highlight the importance of the wax palm and the species. These campaigns caused people to stop hunting the parrot and felling the palms, and encouraged the government and FARC to enforce a ban on harming the parrot and the palm (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). In 2003, the head of the Catholic church in Colombia overturned a two-century old tradition of using wax palm fronds in Palm Sunday processions with an immediate and effective nationwide ban on using wax palms (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Police, military and regional environmental agencies in Colombia conducted nationwide checkpoints to confiscate wax palm fronds (Salaman <em>et al</em>. 2019). Combined with on-the-ground actions such as fencing of breeding sites to allow wax palm regeneration, habitat restoration and provision of artificial nest boxes<strong></strong>, the species's population size has increased significantly<strong></strong> (Salaman 2001, Waugh 2004,<strong> </strong>Fundación ProAves <em>in litt.</em> 2010, 2012, Salaman <em>et al</em>. 2019)<strong></strong>.

In 2009, Fundación ProAves established a corridor of over 6,600 ha for <em>Ognorhynchus </em>and other threatened parrots across the Central Cordillera in Colombia<strong> </strong>(Salaman <em>et al</em>. 2019). At San Luis de Cubarral, the use of artificial nests was initiated in 2011, and it is reported that the population has increased as a result (<em>per</em> O. Cortes <em> in litt</em>. 2013).

It is undergoing extremely rapid declines, mainly due to the impacts of habitat loss and trapping pressure. It is consequently listed as Critically Endangered.","Recent surveys along the coast of Ecuador have located this species in areas with a presence of both mangrove and dry tropical forest, or algarrobo <em>Prosopis julifora</em> (M. Pilgrim and B.  Biddle <em>in litt</em>. 2013, Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020, H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species persists in disturbed forest fragments and probably frequents a variety of forest habitats, including dry scrub and modified areas such as plantations (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997). It roosts communally every night, preferably on mangrove islands (Berg and Angel 2006). Breeding has been noted in January-March (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Most of Ecuador's forests and mangroves have been cleared since the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, with aquaculture pond development for shrimp farming being the main driver of mangrove loss (B. Biddle <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The clearance and unsustainable use of mangroves may have slowed because of protection measures, but loud bird-scaring devices used at existing shrimp farms are likely to cause disturbance to the species (B. Biddle <em>in litt</em>. 2014). Overall, habitat loss and degradation driven by agricultural expansion, cutting of firewood and development are regarded as on-going threats to this species. Trapping pressure is another on-going threat; it is thought that a large proportion of the communities within the range keep the species as pets (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020). The population near Bahia de Caraquez has been severely reduced to the trapping (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","The roost near Bahia de Caraquez contains roughly 60-116 individuals, equating to 40-80 mature individuals (Biddle <em>et al</em>. 2020). Counts for the roost in Santa Elena fluctuate, with high counts of 2,340 and 2,578 individuals in 2019 and 2020 (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020).

Remaining habitat is fragmented, and both range and population are thought to be declining. As a result, the species qualifies as Endangered.<p></p>","The species inhabits very humid, tropical forest. It is primarily found from 800-1,300 m, occasionally as low as 300 m and as high as 1,800 m (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020). It has been reported to tolerate some habitat fragmentation (Schaefer and Schmidt 2003). It mostly occurs in groups of 4-15 individuals, although a flock of 60 has been observed. It feeds on various fruit (including figs [<em>Ficus</em> sp.]), fruits and <em>Cecropia</em> flowers<strong></strong> (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000). It appears to favour <em>Dacryodes peruviana </em>(Burseraceae) for nesting<strong> </strong>(Garzón and Juiña 2007), but a pair exhibited pre-nesting behaviour in the cavity of a small Meliaceae tree in 1997<strong></strong> (Snyder <em>et al.</em> 2000). Nests have been reported in natural cavities 1.8-24 m above the ground in a variety of tree species (Schaefer and Schmidt 2003). About 75% of the population breed cooperatively (Klauke <em>et al</em>. 2013). The breeding season lasts from November to March<strong> </strong>(Garzón and Juiña 2007). Seasonal movements to lower altitudinal forests have been reported at Buenaventura<strong> </strong>(H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt. </em>2007). <p></p>","Below 900 m, the rate of deforestation in west Ecuador was 57% per decade in 1958-1988, although in the higher parts of its range, with steeper terrain and a harsher climate, deforestation is slower and a greater proportion of forest remains<strong></strong> (Dodson and Gentry 1991). In particular, rapid rates of logging around Piñas and Manta Real occurred during the late 1980s and 1990s (N. Simpson <em>in litt.</em> 2000). Typically, these areas were then burnt for cattle-farming. Mining is an additional threat (H. M. Schaefer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Lack of suitable nesting trees may be a limiting factor and nesting at suboptimal sites may increase predation by species such as Crimson-rumped Toucanet<strong> </strong><em>Aulacorhynchus haematopygus</em><strong> </strong>(Anon. 2006, Garzón and Juiña 2007, Waugh 2007, Garzón <em>et al</em>. 2020)<strong></strong>. Its favoured nesting tree <em>Dacryodes peruviana </em>is highly sought after and frequently targeted for human use<strong> </strong>(Garzón and Juiña 2007).<em> </em>Subpopulations may be isolated due to habitat fragmentation; for example, genetic differentiation was found between groups only 2 km apart (Klauke <em>et al</em>. 2016). Owing to the cooperative breeding system, only ~50% of mature individuals reproduce in a given breeding season. The species suffers from limited genetic diversity, as reproductive output is directly related to the genetic diversity of flocks (Klauke <em>et al.</em> 2013). Inbreeding is known to occur, although its effects are unclear (H. M. Schaefer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2020). Climate change is apparently causing a very pronounced upslope shift in distribution (now 900-1,800 m within the Buenaventura valley where it was originally 600-1,100 m in the 1980s; Klauke <em>et al.</em> 2016), with a corresponding drastic shrinking of distribution size and available habitat similar to Ecuadorian Tapaculo (Hermes <em>et al. </em>2017).<p></p>","The largest population is found at Buenaventura Reserve, where a population size of 171 individuals was estimated in 2005-2006<strong> </strong>(Garzón and Juiña 2007, H.

Outside of Buenaventura, a survey recorded maximum numbers of 77 individuals in Ñalacapac, 97 in Palo Solo and 80 in Paccha (Echeverría and Garzón 2016). The population in El Oro province is currently estimated at 550-609 individuals, with an additional 86-91 individuals in Azuay province (Garzón <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species's cooperative breeding system means that the number of breeding birds may be significantly fewer (H. M. Schaefer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).

Thus, the species is thought to exist in a very small and restricted population, at present confined to Samar, and Mindanao, with the stronghold of the population residing on Tawi-Tawi of the Sulu Islands. Major threats such as deforestation and habitat degradation as well as ongoing trapping for trade are also contributing to a continuing decline.

The species may therefore occur across tropical, lowland, and montane forests, as well as mangrove swamps and degraded forests (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997).","Trapping of adults and nestlings for the cagebird and pet trade are the most significant threats, with heavy trapping particularly extensive in the early 2000s (P.
