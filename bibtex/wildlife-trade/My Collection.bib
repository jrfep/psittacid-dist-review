abstract = {Abstract: Although the poaching of nestlings for the pet trade is thought to contribute to the decline of many species of parrots, its effects have been poorly demonstrated. We calculated rates of mortality due to nest poaching in 23 studies of Neotropical parrots, representing 4024 nesting attempts in 21 species and 14 countries. We also examined how poaching rates vary with geographic region, presence of active protection programs, conservation status and economic value of a species, and passage of the U.S. Wild Bird Conservation Act. The average poaching rate across all studies was 30{\%} of all nests observed. Thirteen studies reported poaching rates of ≥20{\%}, and four reported rates openface{\textgreater} 70{\%}. Only six studies documented no nest poaching. Of these, four were conducted on islands in the Caribbean region, which had significantly lower poaching rates than the mainland Neotropics. The other two studies that showed no poaching were conducted on the two species with the lowest economic value in our sample ( U.S. retail price). In four studies that allowed direct comparison between poaching at sites with active nest protection versus that at unprotected sites, poaching rates were significantly lower at protected sites, suggesting that active protection efforts can be effective in reducing nest poaching. In those studies conducted both before and after the passage of the U.S. Wild Bird Conservation Act, poaching rates were found to be significantly lower following its enactment than in the period before. This result supports the hypothesis that the legal and illegal parrot trades are positively related, rather than inversely related as has been suggested by avicultural interests. Overall, our study indicates that poaching of parrot nestlings for economic gain is a widespread and biologically significant source of nest mortality in Neotropical parrots. Resumen: Aunque se piensa que el saqueo de polluelos para el mercado de mascotas contribuye a la declinaci{\'{o}}n de muchas especies de loros, no se han demostrado sus efectos. Calculamos las tasas de mortalidad debido al saqueo de nidos en 23 estudios de loros neotropicales, que representan 4,024 intentos de anidar en 21 especies y 14 pa{\'{i}}ses. Tambi{\'{e}}n examinamos la variaci{\'{o}}n de las tasas de saqueo por regi{\'{o}}n geogr{\'{a}}fica, la presencia de programas activos de protecci{\'{o}}n, el estatus de conservaci{\'{o}}n y el valor econ{\'{o}}mico de las especies y la aprobaci{\'{o}}n del Acta de Conservaci{\'{o}}n de Aves Silvestres de E. U. A. La tasa promedio de saqueo en todos los estudios fue del 30{\%} del total de nidos observados. Trece estudios reportaron tasas de saqueo ≥20{\%} y 4 estudios reportaron el saqueo de{\textgreater} 70{\%}. Solo 6 estudios no documentaron saqueo de nidos. De estos, 4 se llevaron a cabo en islas de la regi{\'{o}}n del Caribe, que tuvieron niveles de saqueo significativamente menores que en el continente. Los otros dos estudios que no mostraron saqueo se llevaron a cabo con las 2 especies de menor valor econ{\'{o}}mico en nuestra muestra ( precio de venta en E.U.A.). En cuatro estudios que permitieron comparaciones directas entre el saqueo en sitios con protecci{\'{o}}n activa de nidos versus sitios sin protecci{\'{o}}n, las tasas de saqueo fueron significativamente menores en los sitios protegidos, lo que sugiere que los esfuerzos activos de protecci{\'{o}}n pueden ser efectivos para reducir el saqueo de nidos. En los estudios llevados a cabo antes y despu{\'{e}}s de la aprobaci{\'{o}}n del Acta de Conservaci{\'{o}}n de Aves Silvestres de E. U. A., las tasas de saqueo fueron significativamente menores despu{\'{e}}s que antes de la probaci{\'{o}}n del Acta. Este resultado apoya a la hip{\'{o}}tesis de que el comercio legal e ilegal de loros est{\'{a}}n positivamente relacionados, y no inversamente relacionados como sugieren los intereses de aricultura. En conclusi{\'{o}}n, nuestro estudio indica que el saqueo de pollos de loros para su venta es un factor de mortalidad de nidos de loros neotropicales generalizado y biol{\'{o}}gicamente significativo.},

abstract = {The trade in wild animals involves one-third of the world's bird species and thousands of other vertebrate species. Although a few species are imperiled as a result of the wildlife trade, the lack of field studies makes it difficult to gauge how serious a threat it is to biodiversity. We used data on changes in bird abundances across space and time and information from trapper interviews to evaluate the effects of trapping wild birds for the pet trade in Sumatra, Indonesia. To analyze changes in bird abundance over time, we used data gathered over 14 years of repeated bird surveys in a 900-ha forest in southern Sumatra. In northern Sumatra, we surveyed birds along a gradient of trapping accessibility, from the edge of roads to 5 km into the forest interior. We interviewed 49 bird trappers in northern Sumatra to learn which species they targeted and how far they went into the forest to trap. We used prices from Sumatran bird markets as a proxy for demand and, therefore, trapping pressure. Market price was a significant predictor of species declines over time in southern Sumatra (e.g., given a market price increase of approximately {\$}50, the log change in abundance per year decreased by 0.06 on average). This result indicates a link between the market-based pet trade and community-wide species declines. In northern Sumatra, price and change in abundance were not related to remoteness (distance from the nearest road). However, based on our field surveys, high-value species were rare or absent across this region. The median maximum distance trappers went into the forest each day was 5.0 km. This suggests that trapping has depleted bird populations across our remoteness gradient. We found that less than half of Sumatra's remaining forests are {\textgreater}5 km from a major road. Our results suggest that trapping for the pet trade threatens birds in Sumatra. Given the popularity of pet birds across Southeast Asia, additional studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and magnitude of the threat posed by the pet trade.},

abstract = {The international pet trade is a major source of emerging invasive vertebrate species. We used online resources as a novel source of information for accidental bird escapes, and we investigated the factors that influence the frequency and distribution of bird escapes at a continental scale. We collected information on over 5,000 pet birds reported to be missing on animal websites during the last 15 years in Australia. We investigated whether variables linked to pet ownership successfully predicted bird escapes, and we assessed the potential distribution of these escapes. Most of the reported birds were parrots ({\textgreater} 90{\%}), thus, we analysed factors associated with the frequency of parrot escapes. We found that bird escapes in Australia are much more frequent than previously acknowledged. Bird escapes were reported more frequently within, or around, large Australian capital cities. Socio-economic factors, such as the average personal income level of the community, and the level of human modification to the environment were the best predictors of bird escapes. Cheaper parrot species, Australian natives, and parrot species regarded as peaceful or playful were the most frequently reported escapees. Accidental introductions have been overlooked as an important source of animal incursions. Information on bird escapes is available online in many higher income countries and, in Australia, this is particularly apparent for parrot species. We believe that online resources may provide useful tools for passive surveillance for non-native pet species. Online surveillance will be particularly relevant for species that are highly reported, such as parrots, and species that are either valuable or highly commensal.},

abstract = {Estimating population sizes in the heavily traded grey parrots of West and Central Africa would provide insights into conservation status and sustainability of harvests. Ideally, density estimates would be derived from a standardized method such as distance sampling, but survey efforts are hampered by the extensive ranges, patchy distribution, variable abundance, cryptic habits and high mobility of the parrots as well as by logistical difficulties and limited resources. We carried out line transect distance sampling alongside a simpler encounter rate method at 10 sites across five West and Central African countries. Density estimates were variable across sites, from 0–0.5 individuals km−2 in C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire and central Democratic Republic of the Congo to c. 30 km−2 in Cameroon and {\textgreater} 70 km−2 on the island of Pr{\'{i}}ncipe. Most significantly, we identified the relationship between densities estimated from distance sampling and simple encounter rates, which has important applications in monitoring grey parrots: (1) to convert records of parrot groups encountered in a day's activities by anti-poaching patrols within protected areas into indicative density estimates, (2) to confirm low density in areas where parrots are so rare that distance sampling is not feasible, and (3) to provide a link between anecdotal records and local density estimates. Encounter rates of less than one parrot group per day of walking are a reality in most forests within the species' ranges. Densities in these areas are expected to be one individual km−2 or lower, and local harvest should be disallowed on this basis.},

Species commonly found in the market make more enjoyable pets, are more abundant in the wild and more accessible to humans. They are also mostly found within 50 miles of the city, but some found at greater distances are probably brought to the market by wildlife traders, ‘itinerant fences' who travel around buying parrots poached by villagers.

abstract = {The illegal trafficking of wildlife is a prominent threat to biodiversity, human health and security, and sustainable development (Gore et al., 2019). The taxa and geographies impacted are diverse as are the socio-economic drivers of this illicit trade. As legal and illegal wildlife markets commingle and varied traditional uses of wildlife persist, evolve, and converge across the planet, there are increasingly diverse actors participating, ranging from wildlife harvesters and intermediaries, who facilitate market transactions, to the final wildlife consumers (Phelps et al., 2016). Unsurprisingly, there has been an exponential increase in research on wildlife crime among practitioners and scholars within the conservation and criminological sciences (Kahler {\&} Gore, 2017; McFann {\&} Pires, 2018). However, wildlife crime research has been largely qualitative or conceptual in orientation (McFann {\&} Pires, 2018), biased towards the African context, focused predominantly on mammals, and tends to be aimed at understanding ‘why' (i.e., poacher perspective) rather than ‘how' the crime takes place (Kahler {\&} Gore, 2017). The study by S{\'{a}}nchez-Mercado et al. (2020) addresses many of these research gaps by fusing qualitative and quantitative approaches of social network analysis to examine the typology of actors and structure of the trade network of an endangered songbird in South America. Their focus on the trafficking of the Red Siskin (RS) (Spinus cucullatus), a rare neo-tropical finch species, within the context of Venezuela facilitates theory testing with implications for designing critical interventions to reduce their illegal trade. In an innovative and interdisciplinary approach, the authors test the hypothesis that these high-valued birds would be subject to parallel trafficking, or movement alongside other illicit goods, given the situational factors of high corruption and criminality, and compromised governance and enforcement in Venezuela. Through the use of informants, expertise gleaned from prior research, and snowball sampling the authors were able to conduct an impressive 108 interviews with a mixture of harvesters, intermediaries, and consumers of the RS in Venezuela. Additionally, they compiled a complimentary database by monitoring online media platforms to find records of use, actors involved, and to better understand the geographic variations in RS demand and supply. The findings of S{\'{a}}nchez-Mercado et al. (2020) constitute an alarm call for the RS in Venezuela and beyond. The authors point out that the estimated extraction rate of 70 individual birds per year in western Venezuela may not be comparable to the trade volume of other passerine species. However, they aptly assert that proportional to the remaining wild RS population, estimated to be a few thousand, reducing the illegal trade will be a necessary part of species recovery. Further, S{\'{a}}nchez-Mercado et al. (2020) found no evidence that the trade of RS was parallel to other illicit goods. Rather they found the network under scrutiny consists of opportunistic and specialist commercial harvesters, a variety of intermediaries including vendors, launderers, processors and third-party actors, and consumers that either owned or bred the birds. Additionally, their data suggests that a small group of specialized intermediary actors serve as a fulcrum within the supply network, connecting largely disconnected harvesters to markets. Lastly, S{\'{a}}nchez-Mercado et al. (2020) discover, in addition to domestic markets, evidence of regional and transcontinental trade. Data were indicative of Venezuela serving as a source to consumers as close as Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and the USA but also likely supplying breeders and consumers in the more distant markets of Europe and Asia. The findings presented by S{\'{a}}nchez-Mercado et al. (2020) show many consistencies with criminological studies of parrot poaching in Bolivia (Pires {\&} Clarke, 2011) and Mexico (Pires {\&} Clarke, 2012) and markets in Bolivia and Peru (Pires, 2015). These studies focus on the characteristics of the specific parrot species and how these characteristics hamper or facilitate their illegal trade. Consistent with this literature, the findings show a prevalence of specialist commercial harvesters, which is likely driven by the decreasing abundance and accessibility of the bird in western Venezuela. Additionally, demand-side factors in national and international markets are likely to play a role in increasing the number of intermediary actors during the trafficking stage as these facilitators connect increasingly specialized harvesters with affluent consumers (e.g., Pires, 2015). This study by S{\'{a}}nchez-Mercado et al. (2020) is complementary and timely, adding to our understanding of ‘how' and ‘why' diverse actors connect within an illegal rare avian market. Survey research on illicit wildlife trafficking is subject to bias and low levels of cooperation among some actors (e.g., Kahler et al., 2019). The authors acknowledge the research biases that result from their sampling strategy and the use of the self-reporting method. Nonetheless, the authors did not directly ask interviewees if they engaged in non-RS related illegal activities, a central determinant of the parallel trafficking hypothesis. They rely on an arguable assumption that reporting their RS-trade activities as risky may indicate additional criminal behaviors or that interviewees would willingly disclose additional, potentially more serious, criminal behavior. However, it has been found that interviewees may be willing to self-report illicit behavior seen as less risky or serious while failing to disclose behaviors with higher risk or greater consequences (Junger-Tas {\&} Marshall, 1999). Additionally, those with more serious criminal profiles may refuse to participate in surveys all together, leading to non-response bias (Junger-Tas {\&} Marshall, 1999). In conclusion, S{\'{a}}nchez-Mercado et al. (2020) diligently acknowledge that future evidence may emerge indicating parallel trafficking of RS while making the compelling case that there is a conservation need to respond to the current specialized RS trafficking network within Venezuela. The lessons learned from this novel study lend themselves to what the authors call an “induction” approach, which leverages more targeted interventions at well-connected, central actor types to change behavior along the supply chain from harvester to consumer. It is very likely that S{\'{a}}nchez-Mercado et al. (2020) discovered “the tip of the Red Siskin trade iceberg (p. 10)” in terms of the scale of illegal harvest, actors involved, and geographic scope. Studies like this are paramount to advance more robust conservation crime science (Kahler {\&} Gore, 2017) and craft more nuanced and context-specific interventions.},

abstract = {South-East Asia's bird trade is of global conservation concern as it has massively depleted wild populations of many species. Parrots (Order Psittaciformes) are especially vulnerable because they are the most heavily traded group of birds globally under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) appendices. Singapore's involvement in the global pet bird trade as a transhipment hub is well documented, particularly for parrots. Yet, much less is known about the links between its domestic and international trade. We attempt to quantify this relationship by comparing bird trade data on the CITES database with past market surveys of pet shops, complemented with semi-structured interviews with 30 parrot owners in Singapore. We report a decline in total imports and exports of CITES-listed birds in Singapore from 2005 to 2016, consistent with global trends after the European Union trade ban on wild bird imports. However, parrots continue to make up the majority of total imports; and there was a yearly increase in the percentage of parrot imports out of total imports. In addition, we report a difference in imports and exports of 54,207 CITES I, II and III listed birds into Singapore i.e. birds imported but not re-exported. A substantial proportion of these birds were possibly channelled into the domestic pet trade or used as breeding stock. Interviews with parrot owners confirmed the growing demand and popularity of parrots and particularly of larger species. We conclude that the domestic demand for parrots may have been previously underestimated, and make recommendations to manage Singapore's international and domestic pet bird trade such as implementing a licensing and records system to track the movement of birds.},

During fieldwork in 2004, we characterized roosting and nesting patterns on both islands, and estimated the population size of A. p. margaritensis. On Margarita Island, we found a considerable population (at least 1984 individuals), but the 25 nests found were subject to very high rates of poaching (64{\%}) and destruction (32{\%}). Since the only two active roosts of this subspecies were close to or within Laguna de La Restinga National Park, which is also under anthropogenic pressure, our results suggest that this subspecies classifies presently as Endangered (B1a{\&}b[v]). On La Tortuga Island,we found negligible numbers of A. p. tortuguensis on the eastern portion of the island. Moreover, all six nests found had signs of repeated, regular poaching.

We reviewed the species' historical abundance across Ghana, undertook targeted searches during 3- to 5-day visits to 42 100-km2 cells across the country's forest zone, repeated counts at 22 parrot roosts first performed two decades ago and gauged around 900 people's perceptions of the decline and its causes.

Encounter rates averaged 0.15 individuals per hour of targeted search, around 15 times lower than those recorded in the early 1990s.

Interviewees stressed the importance of very tall trees of commercially important species such as Terminalia superba and Ceiba pentandra for nesting and roosting, and believed that the felling of large trees on farmland (42{\%} of responses) and trapping for trade (37{\%}) were the two main causes of decline. Ghana has lost 90–99{\%} of its Grey Parrots since 1992, a time when the population had presumably already been seriously reduced by two decades of extremely heavy trade. There is no evidence that, away from one or two localities, declines are less severe anywhere else within the West African range of P. erithacus, or across the entire range of the recently split Timneh Parrot Psittacus timneh.},

This study examines the role of companion parrots in American households. The study combines a literature review with the results of a survey of bird owners and participant observation.The study uses the resulting qualitative and quantitative data in addressing the social dyna- mics of companion parrot ownership in the household.The data support the impression that companion parrots increasingly are being considered family members, or “Fids” (“Feathered Kids”), thus following current trends in American society that accord companion animals in general a greater investment in time, money, and emotion. However, the general public is not well informed about the complexities of captive parrot care, and psittacine well- ness is an important concern.},

abstract = {Mexico has 22 species of parrots (psittacines) of w hich six are endemic. Wild parrots are widespread across the country and have a strong connection with Mexican culture. All species except two are officially listed as at risk; 6 species are classified as endangered, 10 as threatened, and 4 as under specia l protection. The foremost threats psittacines face in Mexico are loss of habitat and illegal trapping for the pet trade. While some research has been done in the past regarding p arrot trafficking, the fundamental questions of the volume of illegal trapping, how an d where it is carried out, how trapping affects particular species and how the ill egal trade relates to the legal trade were poorly understood. This assessment provides, for the first time, comprehensive answers to these and related questions, as well as detailed historical information on the regulatory programs applied to parrot trapping, the enforcement of those programs, seizures by enforcement officials, mortality rates of captured parrots, and prices in the legal and illegal trades, including historical tren ds. Based on interviews with trappers and representativ es of their unions, and analysis of other data, an estimated range of 65,000 to 78,500 parrots are captured each year. The overall mortality rate for trapped parrots exceeds 75{\%} before reaching a purchaser, which translates to about 50,000 to 60,000 dead bir ds annually, making this trade terribly inhumane and wasteful. The rate of parrot seizures by the environmental po lice, Procuradur{\'{i}}a Federal de Protecci{\'{o}}n al Ambiente (Profepa), was assessed. The seizures by Profepa represent an average of only about 2{\%} of the annual illegal trad e. Seizure rates appear to be mostly correlated with the level of enforcement effort. I t is apparent that Profepa and other agencies currently lack adequate personnel and budg ets to police the trade. Through analysis of seizure data obtained from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the assessment determined that only a smal l percentage of the annual illegal capture is being smuggled out of the country; about 86{\%} to 96{\%} of all trapped Mexican parrots stay in the internal trade. This is a shif t from the 1970s and 1980s when the lucrative and huge USA market was considered to dri ve the trafficking. Now, Mexico must solve the problem internally. This assessment finds that fewer than 150 registere d trappers have focused on parrots exclusively. No parrot trapping had been authorized by wildlife officials between 2003 and late 2006. Prior to 2003, the trapping regulat ions had many drawbacks. Officials were unable to control the number of specimens take n, the time period or the place of capture. The existence of legal trapping authorizat ions provided cover for the illegal trade, through forging of documents and other illic it methods. Despite the lack of any approved trapping seasons for the last three years unsustainable capture of wild parrots has continued unabated. It takes place all year rou nd, even inside natural protected areas, and affects almost all of the 22 species. Populations of parrots are decreasing due to this e xploitation. Scientific surveys estimate a 25-30{\%} decrease in some species; intervi ews with parrot trappers themselves further corroborate some of these declines. Some pa rrots have been extirpated from large parts of their historic range. Eventual extin ction is foreseeable for whole species if illegal trapping is not reined in. This assessment shows that national and internation al bans have not cause increased smuggling or increased prices of the affected parro t species over the last 10 years. Prices in Mexico and the USA have, in fact, general ly decreased in that time period. Mexico's imports of non-native parrots have sharply increased, but they are too expensive for the huge segment of the Mexican publi c that purchases low-cost, illegal wild-caught parrots. Breeding centers for native pa rrots are few; they can breed only a small number of the 22 species and their prices can not compete with the prices of their wild-caught cousins. This assessment provides policy recommendations to stop the devastating impacts on Mexico's prized native parrots. First and foremost is a well-publicized complete ban on any more trapping authorizations. While authorizations were temporarily halted for three years, new information obtained at the time o f printing this report, in October of 2006, indicated that government official s have issued more trapping authorizations. This could be disastrous as it will provide more cover for the illegal trade and fails to send the needed strong message t o the trappers and traffickers that the government is serious about conserving viable popul ations of parrots for the future. Not only a permanent ban, but also dramatically increas ed enforcement efforts to make the ban effective are needed. This should include incre ased enforcement efforts by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement agents to reduce the illegal trade, especially for the orange fronted parakeet ( Aratinga canicularis ), white fronted parrot ( Amazona albifrons ), yellow cheeked parrot ( Amazona autumnalis ), lilac crowned parrot ( Amazona finschi) and red crowned parrot ( Amazona viridigenalis ), for which smuggling across the border appears to be increasin g, thus is a continuing threat to the species' survival. The lessons about the need for a total ban were lea rned over several decades in a comparable situation when Mexico attempted to cut b ack on sea turtle harvesting, but only after several failed harvesting programs and d rastic population crashes in almost all native sea turtle populations. For parrots, the tim e is ripe to tackle the challenges before it is too late. Several Profepa inspectors intervie wed agreed a permanent ban is needed. The recommended permanent ban on further parrot tra pping should be accompanied by a well-funded bi-national education campaign to mak e the Mexican and USA publics fully aware that it is wrong to buy any parrot that lacks proper documentation. Encouraging the breeding of low-cost exotic parrots could provide a substitute supply of pets. A Mexican government program to train parrot trappers to pursue other work will be vital, such as breeding exotic parrots and guidi ng birdwatchers in the field. An important element of conserving wild populations wi ll be to provide some subsidization of trappers, to shift them from an illegal occupati on to a legal occupation. USA funding should assist in this as well, in view of the vast deleterious impact that consumer demand from the USA had on these species particular ly during the 1970s and 1980s. In sum, only integrated, coherent and well-funded poli cy changes will succeed in solving the biological, economic and social challenges of t he illegal parrot trade.},

abstract = {Innovative approaches are needed to combat the illegal trade in wildlife. Here, we used network analysis and a new database, HealthMap Wildlife Trade, to identify the key nodes (countries) that support the illegal wildlife trade. We identified key exporters and importers from the number of shipments a country sent and received and from the number of connections a country had to other countries over a given time period. We used flow betweenness centrality measurements to identify key intermediary countries. We found the set of nodes whose removal from the network would cause the maximum disruption to the network. Selecting six nodes would fragment 89.5{\%} of the network for elephants, 92.3{\%} for rhinoceros, and 98.1{\%} for tigers. We then found sets of nodes that would best disseminate an educational message via direct connections through the network. We would need to select 18 nodes to reach 100{\%} of the elephant trade network, 16 nodes for rhinoceros, and 10 for tigers. Although the choice of locations for interventions should be customized for the animal and the goal of the intervention, China was the most frequently selected country for network fragmentation and information dissemination. Identification of key countries will help strategize illegal wildlife trade interventions.},

abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) includes how people perceive risks associated with negative interactions with wildlife. Risk perceptions are important for conservationists to understand because perceptions can influence human behaviors in response to HWC, such as tolerance or poaching specific species. Our study site, the Zambezi region of Namibia, is renowned for diverse wildlife that come into conflict with humans and are vulnerable to poaching. Our study objectives were: (1) quantify local perceptions of risk associated with species-specific HWC and poaching, (2) examine the relationship between species-specific HWC and poaching risks, and (3) characterize economic costs, benefits and perceptions of the ecological values (e.g., disease vector) of the top four species implicated in HWCs and poaching. The species that were perceived to be at greatest risk from poaching were characterized as posing high ecological risks (e.g., disease vectors) and livelihood risks (e.g., crop damage) and were economically valuable for local subsistence and trade. Species perceived to pose high risk to livelihoods were moderately correlated with increasing perceived poaching vulnerability (r = 0.53, p = 0.04, df = 14). All but one of the top four species most vulnerable generated greater average annual revenue from legal hunting than average annual damage to crops. However, a majority of participants stated that conservancy benefits were not equitably distributed. Quantifying and characterizing how stakeholders perceive poaching-related risks can complement risk assessment data and result in more robust conservation planning. These findings have implications for risk communication, distribution of wildlife-related risks and benefits and more nuanced management of the most vulnerable species.},

abstract = {Illegal trade constitutes a major threat for a variety of wildlife. A criminology framework has been recently applied to parrot poaching in Mexico, suggesting an opportunistic crime in which the most abundant and accessible species, and not the rare or highly priced species, were poached more often. We analyzed this information, together with additional long-term data (1981-2005) on both the legal and illegal trade of the 22 Mexican parrot species (n = 31,019 individuals), using multivariate statistics and hypothesis-testing approaches. Our results showed a selective capture of parrot species attending to their attractiveness. Parrot species widely differed in attractiveness to people (as reflected by their combined measures of body size, coloration, and ability to imitate human speech), and their attractiveness strongly correlated with their prices both in the Mexican and US markets. The most attractive and valuable species (amazons and macaws) were disproportionally caught attending to the number of years they were legally trapped. Similar patterns were found for parrots poached for the domestic Mexican market, for those smuggled to the USA, and for those legally exported before or after 1992, when the USA ban led parrot exports to be mostly directed to European countries. Finally, the long-term cross-cultural preference for the most attractive species has led them to be among the most threatened species today. Since current parrot poaching mostly responds to local demand, socio-ecological work is needed to reverse the long-standing pet-keeping tradition that may decimate the most desired species in Neotropical countries.},

abstract = {Wild parrots represent one of the greatest commercial interests in the legal trade in wild birds. Although it is difficult to quantify, there is a considerable illegal trade in wild parrots. Thirty-six per cent of the world's parrot species are listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as threatened or near threatened, and 55{\%} of these are threatened to some degree by trade. In this paper, we investigate the impact of protection on the number of nests that failed because of nestlings being taken by humans (hereafter nest take) and on nesting success in parrots. We collate data on parrot nest take from published and unpublished studies from Africa, Asia and Australasia, including countries and sites with and without national and local parrot protection measures in place. Nest take was insignificant in Australia, where all studies were from areas with both local and national protection. For less developed countries, levels of nest take were variable between studies, spanning the whole range from 0 to 100{\%}. Protection significantly reduced nest take and correspondingly increased nesting success. Our results corroborate those for the Neotropics; thus, the advantages of protection appear to be independent of geographical location or political and economic conditions. We analysed data on legal trade in wild-caught parrots before and after implementation of the 1992 Wild Bird Conservation Act (which practically eliminated import of parrots to the USA) and found that there was no apparent shift in parrot imports to other global regions from the Neotropics. We suggest that conservation of parrots globally would benefit from similar legislation introduced in other regions, such as the EU (15), which is responsible for more than 60{\%} of global imports of wild parrots.},

abstract = {Estimating abundance and population size is essential for many ecological and conservation studies of parrots. Achieving these goals requires methods that yield reliable estimates, but parrot traits can make them difficult to detect, count, and capture. We review established and emergent sampling and analytical methods used to estimate parrot abundance and population size, focusing on their assumptions, requirements, and limitations. Roost surveys are cost-effective if all roost locations in a region are known and stable, which is uncommon. Capture–recapture methods incorporate detection probability, but capturing, marking and resighting parrots can be difficult. Distance sampling estimates detection probability and surveys multiple species simultaneously, but is sensitive to the spatial distribution of individuals and excludes birds in flight. Roadside transects can cover large areas and survey multiple species, but habitats near roads may differ from the surrounding areas, biasing abundance estimates. Occupancy surveys and hierarchical models usually require spatially and temporally replicated datasets. Both allow estimation of detection probability; the former dispenses with count data, while the latter is a versatile set of methods that can incorporate multiple processes influencing detection and abundance. Finally, passive acoustic surveys can sample multiple species simultaneously, but identification of vocalisations can be difficult and time-consuming.},

abstract = {Sharks, rays, and chimaeras (Class Chondrichthyes; herein ‘sharks') are the earliest extant jawed vertebrates and exhibit some of the greatest functional diversity of all vertebrates. Ecologically, they influence energy transfer vertically through trophic levels and sometimes trophic cascades via direct consumption and predation risk. Through movements and migrations, they connect horizontally and temporally across habitats and ecosystems, integrating energy flows at large spatial scales and across time. This connectivity flows from ontogenetic growth in size and spatial movements, which in turn underpins their relatively low reproductive rates compared with other exploited ocean fishes. Sharks are also ecologically and demographically diverse and are taken in a wide variety of fisheries for multiple products (e.g. meat, fins, teeth, and gills). Consequently, a range of fisheries management measures are generally preferable to ‘silver bullet' and ‘one size fits all' conservation actions. Some species with extremely low annual reproductive output can easily become endangered and hence require strict protections to minimize mortality. Other, more prolific species can withstand fishing over the long term if catches are subject to effective catch limits throughout the species' range. We identify, based on the IUCN Red List status, 64 endangered species in particular need of new or stricter protections and 514 species in need of improvements to fisheries management. We designate priority countries for such actions, recognizing the widely differing fishing pressures and conservation capacity. We hope that this analysis assists efforts to ensure this group of ecologically important and evolutionarily distinct animals can support both ocean ecosystems and human activities in the future.},

abstract = {Occupancy modelling using data collected by repeatedly sampling sites is a common approach utilised by land managers to understand species distributions and trends. Two important factors that can complicate interpretation of these models are imperfect detection and spatial autocorrelation. We examine the effect of these potential errors using a multi-year data set on the distribution of the migratory and endangered swift parrot (Lathamus discolor). We simultaneously account for these effects by extending a zero-inflated Binomial (ZIB) framework to allow the inclusion of semiparametric, smooth spatial terms into both the occupancy and detection component of the model, in a maximum likelihood framework easily implemented in common software. This approach also has the advantage of relatively straightforward model selection procedures. We show that occupancy and detectability were strongly linked to food availability, but the strength of this relationship varied annually. Explicitly recognising spatial variability through the inclusion of semiparametric spatially smooth terms in the ZIBs significantly improved models in all years, and we suggest this predictor is an effective proxy for unmeasured environmental covariates or conspecific attraction. Importantly, the spatially explicit ZIBs predicted fewer occupied sites in more defined areas compared to non-spatial ZIBs. Given the importance of predicted distributions in land management, habitat protection and conservation of swift parrots, these models serve as an important tool in understanding and describing their ecology. Our results also reinforce the need for designing surveys that capture the underlying spatial structure of an ecosystem, especially when studying mobile aggregating species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Forest structure and composition have been used to assess the habitat characteristics that determine bird distributions. The patterns of distribution have been shaped by historical and ecological factors that play different roles at both temporal and spatial scales. The objectives of this research were to characterize the habitat of the endangered Military Macaw (Ara militaris) and evaluate the potential distribution of this species based on trends of land use changes in Mexico. We characterized the community structure and floristic composition of 8 forests that are currently used by the Military Macaw for breeding and feeding and compared the results with 6 similar forests characterized in other studies but without historical records of the presence of the Military Macaw. The Military Macaw preferred sites with high diversity of plant species dominated by trees from 4 to 15m in height and from 5 to 90cm in diameter at breast height. We identified 236 plant species in the 8 forests with 20 species (8.4{\%}) used for nesting and feeding by the Military Macaw. The floristic composition is important for the presence of the Military Macaw because there were significant differences between forests with and without its presence. The potential area of distribution of the Military Macaw had decreased by 32{\%} and the remnant areas are included in only 8 National Protected Areas. The protected areas of natural forests should be increased to preserve the sites of potential distribution and consequently the habitat of the Military Macaw in Mexico.

abstract = {Documenting changes in distribution is necessary for understanding species' response to environmental changes, but data on species distributions are heterogeneous in accuracy and resolution. Combining different data sources and methodological approaches can fill gaps in knowledge about the dynamic processes driving changes in species-rich, but data-poor regions. We combined recent bird survey data from the Neotropical Biodiversity Mapping Initiative (NeoMaps) with historical distribution records to estimate potential changes in the distribution of eight species of Amazon parrots in Venezuela. Using environmental covariates and presence-only data from museum collections and the literature, we first used maximum likelihood to fit a species distribution model (SDM) estimating a historical maximum probability of occurrence for each species. We then used recent, NeoMaps survey data to build single-season occupancy models (OM) with the same environmental covariates, as well as with time- and effort-dependent detectability, resulting in estimates of the current probability of occurrence. We finally calculated the disagreement between predictions as a matrix of probability of change in the state of occurrence. Our results suggested negative changes for the only restricted, threatened species, Amazona barbadensis, which has been independently confirmed with field studies. Two of the three remaining widespread species that were detected, Amazona amazonica, Amazona ochrocephala, also had a high probability of negative changes in northern Venezuela, but results were not conclusive for Amazona farinosa. The four remaining species were undetected in recent field surveys; three of these were most probably absent from the survey locations (Amazona autumnalis, Amazona mercenaria and Amazona festiva), while a fourth (Amazona dufresniana) requires more intensive targeted sampling to estimate its current status. Our approach is unique in taking full advantage of available, but limited data, and in detecting a high probability of change even for rare and patchily-distributed species. However, it is presently limited to species meeting the strong assumptions required for maximum-likelihood estimation with presence-only data, including very high detectability and representative sampling of its historical distribution.},

Emerging economies, in particular, have a largely overlooked potential for rapid inter- nal growth in this trade. An analysis of {\~{}}17 000 wildlife transportation permits – issued in South Africa primarily for commercial purposes by the Western Cape Province's local government – provides insights into this trend. During the past decade, a total of 912 amphibian, bird, mammal, and reptile species were transported to and from locations in the province; 60{\%} of translocated vertebrate species were non-native. Network analysis of the data indicated that the numbers of participants within local trade networks are increasing rapidly. Static and dynamic structural differences emerged between the networks for selected vertebrate Classes. Changes in density and degree were pronounced for mammal and reptile networks but were more constant for birds over the observed time period. All translocation networks exhibited “small-world”, scale-free properties, which would facilitate the rapid propagation of negative influences through the system.},

abstract = {Partly due to the illegal parrot trade, parrots are one of the most threatened bird species in the world. Trade bans and regulatory schemes have already been implemented, but the illegal parrot trade continues in an unsustainable fashion. Criminological research in the field has begun to understand why certain species are more prone to becoming poached, but not much is known about how illicit markets operate. A prior case study of a Bolivian illicit market found that most poached parrots are found within a 100-mile radius of the market (Pires and Clarke British Journal of Criminology, 51, 314–335, 2011). However, it is unclear if all markets operate in the same local way. Using two recent studies that look at illicit pet markets in seven cities within Peru and Bolivia (Gastanaga et al. Bird Conservational International, 1–10, 2010; Herrera and Hennessey Proceedings of the Fourth International Partners in Flight Conference: Tundra to Tropics, 232–234, 2008), this study investigates if illicit parrot markets fit a standard model. Findings from this study reveal that markets are heterogeneous. Furthermore, a substantial part of the illegal parrot trade involves trafficking species from one market to another and these species are suspected of emanating from just two city markets. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Parrots (Psittaciformes) are among the most threatened bird orders with 28 {\{}{\%}{\}} (111 of 398) of extant species classified as threatened under IUCN criteria. We confirmed that parrots have a lower Red List Index (higher aggregate extinction risk) than other comparable bird groups, and modeled the factors associated with extinction risk. Our analyses included intrinsic biological, life history and ecological attributes, external anthropogenic threats, and socio-economic variables associated with the countries where the parrot species occur, while we controlled for phylogenetic dependence among species. We found that the likelihood of parrot species being classified as threatened was less for species with larger historical distribution size, but was greater for species with high forest dependency, large body size, long generation time, and greater proportion of the human population living in urban areas in the countries encompassing the parrots' home ranges. The severity of extinction risk (from vulnerable to critically endangered) was positively related to the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of the countries of occurrence, endemism to a single country, and lower for species used as pets. A disproportionate number of 16 extinct parrot species were endemic to islands and single countries, and were large bodied, habitat specialists. Agriculture, hunting, trapping, and logging are the most frequent threats to parrots worldwide, with variation in importance among regions. We use multiple methods to rank countries with disproportionately high numbers of threatened parrot species. Our results promote understanding of global and regional factors associated with endangerment in this highly threatened taxonomic group, and will enhance the prioritization of conservation actions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: International wildlife trade is the largest emerging source of vertebrate invasive alien species. In order to prevent invasions, it is essential to understand the mechanics of trade and, in particular, which traded species are most likely to be released or escape into the wild. A species' economic value is a key factor, because we expect cheaper species to be less assiduously secured against escaping, and more likely to be deliberately released. Here, we investigate determinants of the price of species in the Taiwanese bird trade. Taiwan is an international hub for bird trade, and several native species are threatened by alien bird species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY: We investigated the relationship between the traded species sale price in Taiwan and the species availability for trade (the number of birds for sale, geographic range size and their origin, conservation and CITES status) and traits (body size, coloration, song attractiveness). We used phylogenetic generalized least squares models, with multi-model inference, to assess the variables that are best related to the price of birds in the Taiwanese pet trade.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS / CONCLUSIONS: We found that species available for sale in larger numbers, native to Taiwan, not globally endangered, and small-bodied are all relatively cheaper, as too are species lacking yellow coloration and without attractive songs. Our models of price revealed high levels of phylogenetic correlation, and hence that closely related species tended to be sold for similar prices. We suggest that, on the basis of price, native species are more likely to be deliberately or accidentally released than alien species. Nevertheless, our survey of bird shops recorded 160 species alien to Taiwan (7,631 individuals), several of which are for sale cheaply and in large numbers. Alien bird species in trade therefore present an ongoing, non-trivial invasion risk on the island.},

abstract = {The yellow-shouldered parrot (Amazona barbadensis) is listed in Venezuela as Endangered and internationally as Vulnerable, primarily due to poaching for the illegal pet trade. Various interventions have been implemented to reduce poaching (increasing the population from 700 in 1989 to 1600 in 2009), but poaching pressure is still high, and is ever-changing, requiring an evolving response. Between 2000 and 2003, our only intervention was environmental education in schools: in the short term, unsurprisingly, it had no impact on poaching, which reached 100{\%} of nestlings in monitored nests. From 2004 onwards, we implemented a set of new field interventions. In 2004, 24 h field surveillance decreased poaching to 56{\%}. In 2005, the addition of foster nests and a pilot test of “assisted breeding” brought the figure down to 18{\%}. In 2006, assisted breeding was expanded, achieving 0{\%} poaching. In 2007, poachers raided our “secure” site, and took 34 nestlings, bringing poaching up to 60{\%}. A pilot study of artificial nests offered promising results. In 2008 and 2009, the addition of patrolling by local police reduced poaching to 16{\%} and 1{\%}, respectively. During 2004–2009, nestling poaching averaged 25{\%}. Ensuring parrot recruitment in the future will require a combination of the strategies employed to date; in the short term, expanding the use of artificial nests to increase availability of nesting sites in easily-patrolled areas has the most potential to build on past successes.

abstract = {Brazil ' s rich biological and cultural diversity makes it an exceptional location for examining the commerce in live wild birds and its implications for conservation. This paper catalogues the live bird species being traded in Brazil, characterises the trade in these animals, and discusses the implications for avian conservation. In spite of being illegal, capturing and selling birds is still a very common practice in Brazil and involves many actors who make up part of a large commercial network that distributes wild animals to every corner of the country. Our survey revealed that at least 295 bird species are illegally sold as pets in Brazil, with estimates derived from this data pointing to a total of more than 400 species - about 23 {\%} of the number of extant bird species in the country. Of the bird species recorded, two were classi fi ed as “ Critically Endangered ” ,nineas “ Endangered ” ,sixas “ Vulnerable ” ,and 19 as “ Near Threatened ” according to the most recent IUCN Red List. Most of the species recorded in this study as being widely bought and sold (including on the international market) are not listed by CITES even though many of them are in fact threatened. In light of the widespread illegal trade in wild birds in Brazil and the conservation implications for the species involved, there is an urgent need for actions that can control these activities. Steps should be taken to address the illegal traf fi c directly and these must include monitoring, law enforcement, effective sentencing (including deterrent sentences), targeting end-users, captive breeding, and education at all levels, taking into account the cultural, economic, social, and ecological aspects of the human populations involved},

abstract = {Singapore has a long history of involvement in the bird trade. Recent analysis of the trade in CITES Appendix I and II-listed birds from over 30 countries between 2005 and 2014, highlights that Singapore issued commercial import- and export permits for a total of 225 561 and 136 912 birds respectively. This involved 212 species, of which 30 were classified by the IUCN as Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered. Another study on the import and export of CITES-listed birds from the Solomon Islands in 2011 found Singapore to be the importer of 72{\%} of the 68 000 wild-caught and reportedly captive-bred birds from the Solomon Islands, with the vast majority of these birds subsequently being re-exported. In both studies, attention was drawn to the illegal sourcing of birds, and Singapore's role in moving these birds into the legal global market. To understand further the bird trade industry in Singapore, TRAFFIC undertook a rapid assessment of the open bird trade in Singapore's pet shops. Surveys of 39 pet shops, listed by AVA as licensed to sell birds, were conducted over four days in November and December 2015. A full inventory of the species and volumes in trade was documented, excluding domesticated species. This report provides a snapshot of the current composition and availability of openly traded birds in Singapore's AVA-licensed bird selling pet shops. Of the 39 shops visited, 28 were found to be selling birds. A total of 14 085 birds were observed, comprising 109 species. Seven of all species, accounting for a total of 42 individuals, are currently listed in – or have recently been approved for uplisting to – CITES Appendix I. Whether these birds were captive-bred or wild-caught could not be established. The most heavily traded CITES Appendix I-listed bird was the Yellow-shouldered Amazon Amazona barbadensis with at least 16 recorded individuals. Overall, 41 CITES Appendix II species were recorded, totalling 350 individuals. A majority of the species, 97{\%} (n=60) found in trade are currently not listed in CITES. Of the total number of species in trade, 70{\%} involved seven species that were flagged as immediate concern at the first Asian Songbird Crisis Summit in 2015 From the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, only one Critically Endangered species was observed; Yellow-crested Cockatoo Cacatua sulphurea (two individuals). Two Endangered species were encountered, namely Lilac-crowned Amazon Amazona finschi (n=3) and Sun Parakeet Aratinga solstitialis (n=16), although two further species, Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus (n=15) and Straw-headed Bulbul Pycnonotus zeylanicus (n=1), were subsequently (December 2016) uplisted to this category (from Vulnerable). Eight Vulnerable species (excluding Grey Parrot and Straw-headed Bulbul, but including the December 2016 uplisted Greater Green Leafbird Chloropsis sonnerati and Javan White-eye Zosterops flavus) were found, totalling 66 individuals. Sixty-seven percent (9452 individuals of seven species) of the total number of encountered birds were flagged as species of immediate concern at the first Asian Songbird Crisis Summit, held in Singapore in 2015 Of About 70{\%} of these involved seven species that were flagged as immediate concern at the 1st Asian Songbird Crisis Summit two years ago. The most commonly encountered species in trade, accounting for a remarkable 46{\%} of the total seen, was the Oriental White-eye Zosterops palpebrosus (n=6473). Three other species exceeded the 1000-mark of number of birds on sale: Red-whiskered Bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus (n=2811), Zebra Dove Geopelia striata (n=1227) and the Red Avadavat Amandava amandava (n=1030). Of these, only Zebra Dove is native to Singapore. Significantly, 73{\%} of all species (n=80) and 80{\%} of all individuals (n=11 222) observed in trade were not native to Singapore. Of these non-native species, 35{\%} occur on the Indian Subcontinent and in Southeast Asia, while another 31{\%} originate from Central/South America. Recent bird surveys in TRAFFIC other Southeast Asian countries found fewer birds for sale from Central/South America, making Singapore's involvement in the trade in such species unique in the region. This is in contrast to other prominent bird markets in the region, including Jakarta, Malang, Surabaya and Yogyakarta in Indonesia, as well as Bangkok in Thailand that was dominated by species native to the country or elsewhere in Southeast Asia. The high number of birds recorded in trade over a four-day survey in a small city nation like Singapore confirms the popularity of the bird trade in this country. However, a considerable lack of access to trade records (beyond CITES import- and export records) and other regulatory information concerning the harvesting, breeding, and trading of animals in Singapore has rendered a comprehensive assessment of the state of the bird trade impossible. Consequently, it has not been possible to draw any conclusions regarding the sustainability of the industry. Access to such information would aid research, enable the determination of legal and illegal trade levels and provide clarity into the sustainability of the bird trade. In November 2016, Singapore's Agri- Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA), the country's CITES Management Authority, found that 14 of 27 pet bird shops surveyed by the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) did not comply with the government's licensing conditions on welfare. All information gathered from the survey has been shared with AVA for their continued law enforcement monitoring purposes. In light of this study's findings, TRAFFIC makes of the following recommendations to aid in a better understanding of Singapore's role in the global bird trade},

In this review, we explore the scale of IWT, associated threats to biodiversity, and appropriate responses to these threats. We discuss the historical development of IWT research and highlight the uncertainties that plague the evidence base, emphasizing the need for more systematic approaches to addressing evidence gaps in a way that minimizes the risk of unethical or counterproductive outcomes for wildlife and people. We highlight the need for evaluating interventions in order to learn, and the importance of sharing datasets and lessons learned. A more collaborative approach to linking IWT research, practice, and policy would better align public policy discourse and action with research evidence. This in turn would enable more effective policy making that contributes to reducing the threat to biodiversity that IWT represents.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Environment and Resources, Volume 44 is October 17, 2019.

abstract = {The international trade in wildlife has complex interactions with people and the environment which are often poorly understood. Plant, animal and fungi resources support millions of people in both developing and developed countries. In particular, the harvest and trade of wildlife products is a major component of the livelihood strategies for many poor communities in rural and remote areas. However, many wildlife species are vulnerable to harvest and trade, which means trade can pose a significant risk to biodiversity conservation. Global concern about biodiversity loss and widespread illegal trade in several threatened species has raised the potential for further restrictions on international wildlife trade. However, a range of policy options could support a move towards legal and sustainable trade that supports both conservation and livelihoods. For most species, there is a need to increase understanding of the risks and opportunities presented by trade in order to improve the management of its impacts on conservation and livelihoods. This report provides a framework to strengthen the understanding and assessment of the impact of trade in wildlife products on conservation and local livelihoods. It explores the role of interrelated factors related to particular species and their habitat, governance settings, the supply-chain structure and the nature of the end market. Combined, these factors strongly influence the incentives for conservation and the livelihood outcomes of trade. International commercial trade in wildlife and its parts and derivatives is estimated to be expanding, in both volume and value terms. For each species, trade may have positive and negative consequences for conservation and the long-term survival of species and biological diversity. For example, benefits from trade can provide incentives for sustainable use and management of species, but can lead to overharvest and broader negative impacts on the ecosystem. Similarly, trade may have positive or negative consequences for the local livelihoods of the poor, specifically their income source, assets and wellbeing. International demand for wildlife products and services has provided numerous livelihood opportunities for poor communities, because many wildlife resources are in developing countries. However, high-value trade may marginalize poor communities or create dependence on an unsustainable level of harvest. For some species, widespread illegal trade also poses a security threat.},

abstract = {Understanding the traits that drive the demand for exotic pets is crucial for improving our ability to prevent the introduction of new invasive species. We investigated the factors influencing species availability within the Australian cagebird trade. We predicted that species price should be an informative indicator of the species abundance in the trade, and that physical attributes, origin of the species, and limitations for free trade and for captive breeding should be important drivers for species price. We investigated the quantitative relationship between species price and these factors using phylogenetically informed models. 357 species were present in the Australian cagebird trade, and 55.2{\%} were alien. We found a strong negative relationship between species price and abundance. We identified that smaller-bodied, drabber species were cheaper than larger, more colourful species, and that native birds, species that were mostly exempt from regulations to their keeping and trading, and species easier to keep in captivity, tended to be cheaper. Assuming that the more widely held a species the greater the likelihood that is to be released, we propose that price can be used as a proxy for abundance when screening the species that have a higher risk of being deliberately or accidentally introduced.},

abstract = {We studied the breeding biology of the Yellow-shouldered Parrot (Amazona barbadensis) on Margarita Island from March-August, 1990 to 1999. The timing of the different phases (egg-laying, hatching, fledging) was consistent over the years, except during 1998 when all phases were delayed. The average clutch size was 3.38 ± 0.78 eggs per nest, with a range of one to five eggs per clutch, and most eggs survived until hatching (3.36 ± 0.80 eggs per nest). Total clutch size and hatching success of this species on Margarita Island are among the highest in the genus Amazona, suggesting the Yellow-shouldered Parrot has a higher reproductive potential than other species of the genus. We detected interannual differences for some of the reproductive parameters, all in 1998, a year with an extreme drought. Egg losses totaled 20{\%} and were caused by hatching failure, predation, and human disturbance. Forty-nine percent of nestlings were lost, mainly due to poaching. The number of fledglings per nesting pair averaged 1.27 ± 1.61, but varied greatly among years. Thus, in relation to the average total clutch laid, each pair lost an average of 62{\%} of its initial reproductive investment. /// Estudiamos la biolog{\'{i}}a reproductiva de la cotorra Amazona barbadensis en la isla de Margarita entre marzo y agosto desde 1990 hasta 1999.

Most trade regulation focuses on international borders, but managing sub-national trade is one of the greatest challenges in wild bird trade regulation. Sub-national regulation will greatly benefit from a better understanding of how the trade works and what influences it. This thesis examines the structure and spatial pattern of the wild bird trade within Guyana in an attempt to offer insight into how different factors impact patterns in harvesting pressure. Based on market value, it analyzes how selective the harvest becomes as the distance from regional markets and the capital increases. In addition, it examines the associated cost of transportation for both the trapper and the trader.},

abstract = {The red-tailed Amazon (Amazona brasiliensis) is a parrot endemic to the coastal regions of the southeast Brazil. It is part of the official list of threatened Brazilian species and is considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Illegal trade and habitat loss are the main threats to this species. Thus, immediate actions in order to avoid declination and further extinction of this parrot are of utmost importance. An essential tool concerning avian conservation is to address disease risk and the role that the pathogens can play in the threatened wildlife populations. Regarding avian diseases, Chlamydophila psittaci is an important pathogen which can lead to chlamydiosis, a contagious and systemic disease with variable pathogenicity according to strain, host, and stress factors. C. psittaci has already been detected in free-living populations of Brazilian psittacines in Pantanal. In the present study C. psittaci investigation was conducted in free-living populations of the threatened red-tailed Amazon (Amazona brasiliensis) in Paran{\'{a}} State. This work is part of the actions carried out by red-tailed Amazon Conservation Project in Brazil. For the C. psittaci's survey, tracheal and cloacal swab samples were collected from 117 red-tailed Amazon free-living nestlings and submitted to polimerase chain reaction (PCR). C. psittaci's DNA was detected in 1.2{\%} (1/117) of the samples from the parrots analyzed. Factors related to disease emergency can be complicated and would require ongoing work supported by field epidemiology and laboratory research. Concerning the red-tailed Amazon population, further health surveillance and conservation of their habitat still need to be conducted in order to assure their long- term survival. KEY WORDS.

Previous research has attempted to explain why some parrot species are more likely to be poached for illicit markets, though these studies suffer from a small sample size or focus on a singular illicit market. Whether these past findings are generalizable to other markets in other countries remains unknown. Using two recent conservation studies that examine illicit pet markets in seven cities within Peru and Bolivia (Gastanaga et al., Bird Conservational International, 1–10, 2010; Herrera and Hennessey, Tundra to Tropics, 232– 234, 2008), this study applies the CRAVED model (Clarke, London: Home Office, 1999) to identify which factors are able to explain poaching variation of species. Findings show that the more concealable, available, abundant, and disposable species are poached more often. Enjoyable, removable, and valuable species were not found to be significantly related with poaching. Implications of these findings are discussed},

abstract = {Wildlife trade is a profitable economic activity. Birds are among the most heavily traded animals worldwide, with numerous species threatened by pet trade. Information on both legal and illegal aspects of trade and consumer demand is difficult to obtain across different countries, particularly given substantial socio-economic and cultural variation. Focusing on consumer demand in each country, we conducted a global survey among 105 international experts on bird conservation to identify expected trends, drivers and market characteristics of legal and illegal wild-caught pet bird trade. Our results suggest that future trends in legal bird trade will be mostly driven by socio-cultural motivations and intentional demand for wild-caught, rather than captive-bred birds. Bird popularity and rarity are the main factors expected to influence the choice of which bird species will be the most traded legally. Percentage of rural population was the main national-level socio-economic predictor for legal bird trade in the future. Demand for future illegal trade is expected to be driven by bird popularity and particular species identity. Experts consider illegal trade to be sustained mainly by consumers from higher socio-economic and educational backgrounds. Human population growth rate was the main national-level socio-economic predictor of illegal trade expected for the future. Legislation enforcement remains a critical issue in wildlife trade. Expanding trade networks and socio-economic changes continue to incorporate new regions into the wildlife trade. Investigating the multidimensional and synergistic determinants of wildlife trade will thus help address potential detrimental impacts bird trade might cause on biodiversity.},

abstract = {During a period of 12 months in 2007 and 2008, a study of the parrot trade within Peru was carried out. In this study, 20 main wildlife markets were visited in eight cities in order to estimate the number of parrot species and individuals traded legally and illegally within a year. The study also gathered extra information from vendors and customers through informal interviews about the trade process. Additionally we contracted one person in two markets between February and May 2008 to monitor how many species and individuals entered the trade. During the study, four threatened species (the 'Endangered' Gray-cheeked Parakeet Brotogeris pyrrhoptera, the 'Vulner-able' Military Macaw Ara militaris, the 'Vulnerable' Yellow-faced Parrotlet Forpus xanthops and the 'Near Threatened' Red-masked Parakeet Aratinga erythrogenys) and one additional species listed in CITES Appendix 1 (Scarlet Macaw Ara macao) were found being traded. Thirty-four species were recorded in total, 33 of which are native to Peru (representing 63{\%} of the 52 known Peruvian parrot species) and one of which (Monk Parakeet Myiopsitta monachus) is native to Bolivia and Argentina. Our results show that even for the seven species which can be legally traded in Peru, the number of individuals being traded can greatly exceed the numbers that can officially be traded legally. We directly counted 4,722 parrots for sale and using a measured detection rate of 3{\%} we estimate a total market size in the cities surveyed of between 80,000 and 90,000 individuals. As our surveys sampled only 8 out of Peru's 24 departmental capitals and there are also other large cities, these numbers are likely to represent only a part of the total trade in Peru. To the best of our knowledge this is one of the first detailed studies of the internal trade in a source country for the international parrot trade. Our results suggest that such internal trade is likely to be a significant conservation issue that has previously been largely overlooked.},

abstract = {Illegal trade in wild animals for pets is a global conservation and animal-welfare concern. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with different philosophical perspectives toward wildlife work to decrease illegal trade at international and national levels. Our objective was to examine the efforts of conservation and animal-welfare NGOs working to decrease illegal wildlife–pet trade for domestic markets in Peru. We identified 28 NGOs potentially engaged in reducing the trade, and conducted semi-structured interviews with ≥1 representative from each (N = 33 interviews). Only five NGOs, each with a strong dual-perspective toward wildlife that prioritized both wildlife populations and individual wild animals, demonstrated high effort to decrease illegal wildlife–pet trade. These dual-perspective NGOs incorporated anti-trade efforts in all four work categories we identified (i.e., outreach, advocacy, development, and husbandry). Using thematic analysis of interview transcripts, we determined that dual-perspective interviewees were motivated to combat the trade by concern for individual animals and populations—in essence, their moral pluralism. Overall, interviewees considered the government lax with enforcement of wildlife legislation. Interview data suggest that the dual-perspective NGOs' persistent efforts have decreased illegal wildlife–pet trade in two regions of Peru. We recommend that stakeholders and governments searching for collaborators to help curb illegal trade consider approaching NGOs with programs involving conservation of wildlife populations and individual wild animal welfare. We urge the scientific community to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies under different ecological and socio-economic conditions to assist on-the-ground efforts to decrease illegal wildlife–pet trade.},

Most seizures were minor: less than 1{\%} resulting in prosecution of the persons involved. Of cases prosecuted, 46{\%} were for attempted export and 34{\%} for attempted import. Reptiles were targeted most (43{\%}), then birds (26{\%}), and native plants (11{\%}). Seventy percent of prosecutions was a fine only (maximum of {\$}30,000), consistently less than the black market value of the seized goods.

Formation of the Australian Wildlife Forensics Network and ongoing support from the Australian Federal Police for research into improved options for policing are exciting developments.

CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, seeks to ensure international wildlife trade is sustainable, relying on trade bans and controls. However, there has been little comprehensive review of its effectiveness and here we review approaches taken to regulate wildlife trade in CITES. Although assessing its effectiveness is problematic, we assert that CITES boasts few measurable conservation successes. We attribute this to: non-compliance, an over reliance on regulation, lack of knowledge and monitoring of listed species, ignorance of market forces, and influence among CITES actors. To more effectively manage trade we argue that interventions should go beyond regulation and should be multi-faceted, reflecting the complexity of wildlife trade. To inform these interventions we assert an intensive research effort is needed around six key areas: (1) factors undermining wildlife trade governance at the national level, (2) determining sustainable harvest rates for, and adaptive management of CITES species, (3) gaining the buy-in of local communities in implementing CITES, (4) supply and demand based market interventions, (5) means of quantifying illicit trade, and (6) political processes and influence within CITES.},

abstract = {This review reports on the effects of human activities on animal acoustic signals published in the literature from 1970 to 2009. Almost 5{\%} of the studies on variation in animal communication tested or hypothesised on human impacts, and showed that habitat fragmentation, direct human disturbance, introduced diseases, urbanization, hunting, chemical and noise pollution may challenge animal acoustic behaviour. Although acoustic adaptations to anthropogenic habitats have been documented, human impacts have most often generated neutral variation or potential maladaptive responses. Negative impacts have been postulated in the sexual signals of fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals; these are concerning as any maladaptive alteration of sexual behaviour may have direct bearings on breeding success and ultimately population growth rate. Acoustic communication also facilitates other vital behaviours influenced by human-driven perturbations. Bat and cetacean echolocation, for instance, is disrupted by noise pollution, whereas bird and mammal alarming is also affected by introduced diseases and hunting. Mammal social signals are sensitive to noise pollution and hunting, and birds selecting habitats by means of acoustic cues are especially vulnerable to habitat loss. Anthropogenic intervention in these cases may have a negative impact on individual survival, recruitment and group cohesion, limiting rescue-effects and triggering Allee effects. Published evidence shows that acoustic variation may be used as an early-warning indicator of perturbations even when not directly affecting individual fitness. Acoustic signalling can be studied in a broad range of ecosystems, can be recorded, analyzed, synthesised and played back with relative ease and limited economic budget, and is sensitive to many types of impacts, thus can have great conservation significance.

Parrots are one of the species most affected by this trade, which has occurred for over a thousand years but has become one of the leading reasons why so many parrot species are on the brink of extinction. There is a high demand for parrots as pets not only by people in developed nations, such as the United States, but also from people in countries where parrots are native. Sadly, few people who keep parrots truly understand their requirements for survival and the majority of parrots involved in the trade are kept in poor conditions and on inadequate diets. Hypovitaminosis A is the nutritional disorder most commonly seen in captive parrots in Latin American countries. This paper presents a review of the parrot trade in Latin America and of hypovitaminosis A in parrots. A relationship between these two subjects is established to show how knowledge of proper nutrition may aid conservation.},

abstract = {The Amazon basin holds very high parrot species richness but almost nothing is known of parrot population densities in the region or how these vary between species, habitats, sites, and seasons. Such data are becoming important as humans impact on increasing areas of the region. Seventeen parrot species were surveyed using a line transect distance sampling method over 3 yr in floodplain and terra firme forests at two sites in the Tambopata region of southeast Peru. Density estimates for most species were in the range of 3.3–7.8/km2, with Brotogeris cyanoptera and Amazona farinosa reaching densities of 22 and 23/km2 in floodplain forest during the dry season. Parrot densities were higher in floodplain forest than in terra firme forest at both sites. The parrot communities of terra firme forests were similar across sites and seasons, but those in floodplain forests differed widely across sites and across seasons. Upper canopy birds are notoriously difficult to survey. We introduce a procedure to correct for the likely violation of the assumption that all birds on the transect line are detected (distance sampling assumption g(0) = 1). We correct g(0) based on calling rates of birds using a cue-counting technique. Multipliers for g(0) differ across species and site, but not season. This method yielded density estimates on average 22 percent higher (6–40{\%} higher in individual species) than those from the standard method. La Cuenca del Amazonas tiene una riqueza de especies de psit{\'{a}}cidos muy alta, pero poco se conoce sobre la densidad poblacional de estos en la regi{\'{o}}n o como estas var{\'{i}}an entre las especies, h{\'{a}}bitats, sitios y {\'{e}}pocas.

Las densidades estimadas para la mayor{\'{i}}a de las especies estuvieron en el rango de 3.3 a 7.8 individuos por km2, con Brotogeris cyanoptera y Amazona farinosa se alcanzaron densidades entre 22 y 23 individuos por km2 en bosques inundables durante la {\'{e}}poca seca. Las densidades de psit{\'{a}}cidos fueron mayores en bosques inundables que en bosques de tierra firme en ambos sitios.

abstract = {Although most often considered independently, subsistence hunting, domestic trade, and international trade as components of illegal wildlife use (IWU) may be spatially correlated. Understanding how and where subsistence and commercial uses may co-occur has important implications for the design and implementation of effective conservation actions. We analyzed patterns in the joint geographical distribution of illegal commercial and subsistence use of multiple wildlife species in Venezuela and evaluated whether available data were sufficient to provide accurate estimates of the magnitude, scope, and detectability of IWU. We compiled records of illegal subsistence hunting and trade from several sources and fitted a random-forest classification model to predict the spatial distribution of IWUs. From 1969 to 2014, 404 species and 8,340,921 specimens were involved in IWU, for a mean extraction rate of 185,354 individuals/year. Birds were the most speciose group involved (248 spp.), but reptiles had the highest extraction rates (126,414 individuals/year vs. 3,133 individuals/year for birds). Eighty-eight percent of international trade records spatially overlapped with domestic trade, especially in the north and along the coast but also in western inland areas. The distribution of domestic trade was broadly distributed along roads, suggesting that domestic trade does not depend on large markets in cities. Seventeen percent of domestic trade records overlapped with subsistence hunting, but the spatial distribution of this overlap covered a much larger area than between commercial uses. Domestic trade seems to respond to demand from rural more than urban communities. Our approach will be useful for understanding how IWU works at national scales in other parts of the world.},

abstract = {The Neotropics are home to a large diversity of the avian family Psittacidae that experience grave conservation issues such as habitat loss and capture for trade. Of the some 159 species in the Neotropics, half are threatened while the plight of 9 have already led to extinction. Conservation efforts, including work to quantify population trends, are needed to ensure informed conservation planning that will lead to successful conservation of these enigmatic species. The sixteen Psittacidae species occurring in Nicaragua are not exempt from the threats that confront the majority of Neotropical psittacids. The Great Green Macaw (Ara Ambiguus) is listed as Endangered and the Yellow-naped Parrot (Amazona auropalliata) as Vulnerable, but the reality is that conservation statuses of all psittacids need to be evaluated. In 1994 a national psittacid monitoring program was established to assist the government of Nicaragua and CITES-Nicaragua in setting sustainable export quotas. The population monitoring was repeated in 1999, 2004, and a fourth replication will be completed by April 2013. The robust body of data allows for a population trend analysis over an almost 20-year period. A point count method was implemented that collects data at approximately 400 points over an 8-week period covering a representation of the three ecological regions of the country. In addition, the study design allows for the assessment of the protected areas system's effectiveness in conserving psittacid populations. Analysis of data from 1994 to 1999 and 1999 to 2004 show general population declines and despite a 2004 national ban of the capture and trade of all psittacids, we expect to find population decreases continue for the majority of psittacids due to continued habitat loss and illegal capture and trade. Data analysis will be completed in May resulting in the 20-year population trends and management suggestions for the Nicaraguan government and NGOs that work within the country.},

Major importers from Singapore included Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Japan. Singapore imported significant quantities of CITES-listed birds from African countries, including the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and South Africa, a number of which have a history of abuse of CITES export permits, discrepancies in reported trade data, or an acknowledged lack of wildlife law enforcement capacity.

abstract = {The illegal wildlife trade is one of the most profitable illegal industries in the world, only behind the trafficking of drugs, guns, and humans. Because of the relative ease in poaching wildlife combined with the possibility of high profit margins, many assume that organized crime is heavily linked to the trade. One group of species that is poached, trafficked and sold in illicit markets throughout the world are parrots. While some have claimed organized crime groups are involved in the trade, parrot experts contend there is no evidence of organized crime being involved. The purpose of this paper is to examine the structural organization of the illegal parrot trade in the neotropics to determine if the trade is driven by organized crime or if it is a simply a crime that is organized. The following study is based on 38 interviews with parrot poachers, middlemen, wildlife market sellers, and others knowledgeable on the trade in multiple cities within Bolivia and Peru to better understand the organization of the trade. The results garnered from these interviews do not support the notion that organized crime is involved in the illegal parrot trade in either country. The vast majority of participants are freelance operators where there appears to be no formal organization between or amongst those operating in the parrot trade. Implications of findings are discussed. Keywords},

abstract = {Legal international trade of wild animals is controversial because some experts speculate that it facilitates illegal domestic trade in source countries. Wild-caught birds are commonly traded as pets, both legally and illegally, for international and domestic markets. We used Peru's native bird trade as a case study to explore the relationship between legal international and illegal domestic trade. Peru's current quota system started in 2001 and is designed to permit limited export of wild-caught birds, while domestic trade is largely prohibited. We surveyed 40 markets in nine cities (March 2007-July 2011), where we examined tabulated government seizure records and export quotas, and compared proportions of native birds with and without quotas in markets and seizures. Sixteen independent variables were evaluated using generalized linear models to explain native bird abundance in the markets and government seizures. We observed a thriving illegal domestic market with 130 native species (n = 35,279 birds) offered for sale; parrots were the most abundant birds. We found no evidence that Peru's current quota system facilitated illegal domestic trade; authorities confiscated birds regardless of their quota status. While the current quota system did not influence market abundance, historic export trade did. Peru's domestic market, and likely other illegal Neotropical bird markets, developed as a consequence of high historic exports, now appears driven, in part, by tradition and which birds harvesters are accustomed to trapping to fullfill domestic demand. Improved enforcement of Peru's wildlife legislation would likely be more effective in decreasing illegal domestic trade than eliminating quotas.},

abstract = {In some places of the northeastern Peruvian Amazon the harvesting and local trade of parrot nestlings is still a common practice (loreada) that takes place every year between February and April, despite being banned by the national laws. Between 1996 and 1999, I monitored the use of these birds in 3890-ha of Mauritia flexuosa-palm swamps, located close to the village of Victoria (Loreto, Peru). Seven species of parrots were collected by local poachers in the study area, with Amazona amazonica (61.1{\%} of the captures) and Ara ararauna (25.9{\%}) the most commonly harvested. The total number of nestlings taken during the 4-year study period was 1718, ranging from 680 birds harvested in 1996 to 166 in 1998. The two methods used to collect nestlings, cutting down the nesting tree or opening a hole in the trunk to reach the nest cavity, are not sustainable because nest-trees become useless and the next generation is completely removed. The analyses of demographic data and annual harvest rates suggest that at least three species (Ara ararauna, Ara macao and Amazona amazonica) are being over-harvested and may be seriously threatened in the long term. En algunos lugares de la Amazonia Peruana la cosecha y comercializacion de pichones de loros y guacamayos constituye una importante actividad economica (loreada) que tiene lugar entre los meses de febrero y abril de cada ano, a pesar de las prohibiciones legales existentes.

Siete especies de loros y guacamayos fueron extraidas en esta zona destacando, por su cantidad e importancia economica, Amazona amazonica (61.1{\%} de las capturas) y Ara ararauna (25.9{\%}). El numero total de pichones cosechados durante los cuatro anos de estudio fue de 1718, oscilando entre las 680 aves colectadas en 1996 y las 166 colectadas en 1998. Los dos metodos de extraccion utilizados, la tala rasa del tronco-nido o la apertura de un hueco en el mismo, no resultan sostenibles en el tiempo ya que agotan progresivamente los sustratos de anidacion y eliminan todos los pichones de cada nido. Los analisis de datos demograficos y tasas de captura anual sugieren que al menos tres especies (Ara ararauna, Ara macao y Amazona amazonica) estan siendo cosechadas por encima de los niveles maximos de sostenibilidad, poniendo en peligro su conservacion a largo plazo.},

abstract = {The rise of social media is changing the global trade of wildlife, presenting new challenges and opportunities for regulating and monitoring trade in threatened species. Parrots are among the most threatened groups of birds with wild populations of many species exploited in large numbers to supply the global pet trade. This trade increasingly occurs online yet the role of social media remains poorly understood. We examined trade in wild-sourced Grey parrots between 2014 and 2017, integrating data gathered via social media with other information sources and expert knowledge to gain insight into the scale and scope of trade. We identified 259 posts featuring trade in wild-sourced Grey parrots showing parrots held in transport containers or holding facilities. At least 70{\%} of posts featured trade likely in breach of national laws or CITES regulations and basic welfare conditions were frequently not met. An examination of the locations of traders together with ancillary information enabled us to describe a number of opportunities for interventions to disrupt illegal trade, including major trade routes. Overall levels of trade activity, measured as numbers of posts, showed surprisingly little variation over time with the exception of a spike in activity in the months immediately proceeding new restrictions on international trade in wild-sourced Grey parrots for commercial purposes. Throughout the study period, the majority of exports originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo, with smaller numbers of posts from traders in Cameroon, Guinea and Ivory Coast. The trade activity of importers was more dynamic with North Africa playing a diminishing role and countries of the Persian Gulf increasing in prominence. The majority of importers were based in western and southern Asia, notably Turkey, Pakistan, Jordan and Iraq most recently. Turkey also played a prominent role as a transit point for air transport between Africa and Asia. There is an urgent need for targeted actions by airlines and enforcement agencies to disrupt illegal trade and by social media companies to improve monitoring and regulation of wildlife trade online.},

abstract = {Humans' contact with other animals is chiefly organised around humans' own consumption and 'needs'. This article begins with an aspect of the human-non-human animal relationship that is connected to animals as social, not material beings -'pet-keeping'. Over the past few years the pet industry has expanded enormously. I discuss how the keeping of companion animals can be understood, and the consequences for the animals involved; this practice leaves an increasing number vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, not the least dogs-the most common companion animal. The market for companion animals worldwide is fed by breeding, but also by the abduction of animals and birds from their habitats. Keeping companion animals contributes greatly to the endangerment of many species, parrots in particular. Therefore the focus of this paper especially concerns parrots and the consequences they and their species suffer from being abducted, trafficked and traded, whether the trade is criminalized or not. I will discuss implications of the CITES convention, whether it serves to legitimate rather than protect animals from trade, trafficking and suffering. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Timneh Parrots Psittacus timneh are endemic to the moist forests of West Africa. Concerns over rapid declines in populations due to overharvesting for the pet trade and forest loss prompted the species' categorisation as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2016. Despite these threats, few data exist on their biology in the wild, impeding the development of effective conservation initiatives to protect populations. One of the few recorded breeding sites for this species occurs in the Bijag{\'{o}}s Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau, where chicks have been historically harvested from nests and forest clearance for agriculture is common. We investigated the breeding ecology of Timneh Parrots in the Bijag{\'{o}}s Archipelago focusing on two islands that harbour the densest populations. Specifically, we describe nest-site characteristics, breeding phenology and reproductive productivity. Timneh Parrots were found to use secondary nest cavities in 17 species of trees, predominantly nesting in trees between 20 m and 50 m in height. Nest cavities were generally aggregated, with a density of up to 14 nests ha −1 in some areas, although nests also occurred in isolated large trees. The distribution of nests likely reflected a heterogeneous distribution of large trees containing suitable nest cavities, emphasising the importance of protecting mature trees. Nesting efforts were initiated between early January until late March, suggesting that nest surveillance efforts to deter poaching can be efficiently focused at a small number of key sites during February to May each year, when fledgling chicks are most likely to be present. These data further suggest that the population may be limited by the availability of suitable nest cavities and that the installation of artificial nest cavities could help increase the breeding population.

abstract = {Psittaciformes (parrots, cockatoos) are among the most endangered birds, with 31{\%} of Neotropical species under threat. The drivers of this situation appear to be manifold and mainly of anthropogenic origin. However, this assessment is based on the last extensive consultation about the conservation situation of parrots carried out in the 1990s. Given the rapid development of anthropogenic threats, updated data are needed to strategize conservation actions. Using a population approach, we addressed this need through a wide-ranging consultation involving biologists, wildlife managers, government agencies and non-governmental conservation organizations. We gathered up-to-date information on threats affecting 192 populations of 96 Neotropical parrot species across 21 countries. Moreover, we investigated associations among current threats and population trends. Many populations were affected by multiple threats. Agriculture, Capture for the Pet Trade, Logging, each of them affected {\textgreater} 55{\%} of the populations, suggesting a higher degree of risk than previously thought. In contrast to previous studies at the species level, our study showed that the threat most closely associated with decreasing population trends is now Capture for the local Pet Trade. Other threats associated with decreasing populations include Small-holder Farming, Rural Population Pressure, Nest Destruction by Poachers, Agro-industry Grazing, Small-holder Grazing, and Capture for the international Pet Trade. Conservation actions have been implemented on {\textless} 20{\%} of populations. Our results highlight the importance of a population-level approach in revealing the extent of threats to wild populations. It is critical to increase the scope of conservation actions to reduce the capture of wild parrots for pets. Keywords Conservation; Endangered; Macaw; Parakeet; Psittacidae; Psittaciformes},

abstract = {The use of artificial nests is a management technique used to increase the breeding population of endangered parrots. As part of a program devoted to the conservation of the Yellow-shouldered Parrot ( Amazona barbadensis ) on Margarita Island, Venezuela, we placed 16 wooden nests in one of the species' breeding areas in 1993. The dimensions of nest boxe s were based on the average measurements of natural cavities used as nests by Yellow-shouldered Parrots. Artificial nests were placed on tree species used by nesting Yellow-shouldered Parrots, and on other tree species as well. Artificial nests were used by Yellow- shouldered Parrots for the first time in 1997, and during our study a total of four different boxes were used from 1997 to 1999. The overall success of Yellow-shouldered Parrots with artificial nests was poor (5.6{\%}). This could be due to design problems of artificial nest s or to the possibility that cavities were not a limiting resource in this area. Artificial nests suffered higher poaching rates because they were more conspicuous and the chicks were readily accessible through an observation door. A program to recover and improve natural cavities resulted more successful as a management technique for Yellow-shouldered Parrots. All 15 repaired cavities were used repeatedly shortly after being available. Accepted 21 November 2002.},

abstract = {We developed a demographic model to perform a population viability analysis (PVA) of the Blue-throated Ma- caw (Ara glaucogularis), a critically endangered species endemic to Bolivia. PVA simulations were run using individual- based (VORTEX 9.72) and cohort-based (RAMAS GIS 4.0) programs. A baseline simulation allowed for the assessment of the status of the species based on estimates of extinction risk and population declines under current conditions of abun- dance and habitat availability. The role of multiple demographic, environmental, and anthropogenic parameters was evaluated to assess changes affecting population declines and extinction risk. The baseline simulation showed that the Blue-throated Macaw has a relatively low probability of extinction during the next fifty years. However, continuing threats, including declines in abundance, small population size, and low population growth rates, make this species highly vulnerable to any change. Elasticity analysis of the baseline simulation and sensitivity analysis of changes in different demographic parameters demonstrated that increases in adult mortality had the greatest effect on population growth rate and extinction risk. Furthermore, simulations of anthropogenic impacts showed that small increases in habitat loss (2{\%}) and population harvesting (3{\%}) had drastic effects on population decline. Results from this study emphasize the need for conservation actions aimed at protecting breeding individuals (i.e., decreasing adult mortality), preventing poaching ac- tivities, and promoting the conservation of available habitat for nesting sites.

Though bird trade is common in Latin America there are few published studies. Therefore, we reviewed available literature to understand the background of this topic and to identify future relevant research topics. We collected, summarized and discussed literature about bird use as pets in Latin America, with a detailed approach in Mexico. We searched by keywords in web search engines and constructed a database of 159 documents. Brazil was identified as one of the main countries with research on birds use. Most of the papers focused on parrots (35{\%}) and were conducted at a local geographical level (71{\%}). Less than half of the papers (39{\%}) are focused on the general use of birds, 54{\%} on the use as pets and 7{\%} on other uses. In Mexico, 73{\%} of the information is “gray literature”, mainly congress abstracts. This literature review shows that wildlife use in general and wild birds use as pets in particular are common in Latin America. We bring to light that most of the information is not found in peer review journals and contains only lists of useful birds. Finally, we found that research on social organization and on the perceptions of the main actors is scarce, so we suggest more research in this direction in order to implement better management policies},

One-hour surveys of macaws were conducted while traveling along the Rio Manu in a motorized canoe during both the dry and rainy season. There was a significant three-fold decline in the number of macaws encountered during the dry season compared to the rainy season. Encounter rates also varied significantly among macaw species, and may be due to behavioral characteristics or habitat preferences of species. Rapid or short-term surveys used to establish trade quotas and the status of species may be susceptible to biases and inaccuracies resulting from seasonal variations and behavioral characteristics of psittacine species.

abstract = {The challenges faced by small organizations confronting ille- gal wildlife trade (IWT) networks can be large and frighten- ing. In a context of high corruption, political instability and social upheaval, obtaining information about actor identities, connections and trade flows may come with risks to personal security. Yet it is precisely in these contexts that illegal wildlife trade may flourish, piggybacking on trade in other contraband items. In our recent work, we examined the hypothesis that such ‘parallel' trafficking would dominate trade in a threatened, Neotropical finch, the Red Siskin (RS, Spinus cucullatus) in Venezuela (S?anchez-Mercado et al., 2019). Venezuela's economic situation has experienced his- toric declines since 2014: by 2017, {\~{}} 87{\%} of the population lived in poverty, and from 2013 – 2018, GDP fell over 45{\%} (Espa{\~{}}na {\&} Ponce, 2017). We expected the lure of ‘hard' for- eign currency, combined with widespread lawlessness, to drive IWT in this bird, in parallel with other illicit items. In spite of these conditions, although we did find an active and complex RS trade network, we found little evidence for par- allel trade, and instead found a network reliant on special- ized logistical capacity for transport and enforcement evasion, as well as intermediaries with specialized skills. While this finding of an active network was not good news, the network structure we found presents unexpected opportu- nities for small organizations up against this trade challenge, particularly},

Despite widespread recognition of the problem, debates on the science and policy of IWT generally concentrate on a few high-profile species (eg rhinoceros, tigers, elephants) and often overlook or conflate complex IWT products, actors, networks, and contexts. A poor understanding of IWT is aggravated by the lack of systematic vocabulary and conceptual tools with which to analyze complex phenomena in a more structured way. We synthesize the available evidence on IWT across taxa and contexts into a typology-based framework that considers (1) the diversity of wildlife products; (2) the roles of various actors involved with IWT, including harvesters, intermediaries, and consumers; and (3) common IWT network configurations. We propose ways in which these tools can inform structured analyses of IWT, to help ensure more nuanced, appropriate, targeted, and effective responses to illegal wildlife harvest, trade, and use.},

abstract = {Latin America is the single most biologically diverse region of the world, and trade in its wildlife, both legal and illegal, has been prevalent for hundreds of years. Through a variety of law and policy responses, Latin America's wildlife has endured threats from illegal and unsustainable commercial trade both domestically and from the US and Europe. Currently, Latin America's relationship with Asia is undergoing a dramatic change and the rise in transpacific organized crime—including trafficking in persons, drugs, weapons, counterfeit goods, and money laundering—, has accompanied the growth in commerce between the two regions. Much of the attention from the environment sector paid to the growing Asia-Latin America relationship has concerned the direct environmental impacts of Asian investments, yet indications are that trans- Pacific trafficking of wildlife is a rapidly growing problem, and that some supply chains involve professional, organized crime networks that are targeting several high-value taxa. The current nature of the trade in wildlife and the manner in which this trade is evolving suggest that far greater efforts are needed to mitigate its impacts on a wide range of endangered taxa, such as large felids, parrots, primates, frogs and lizards, species for which the illegal trade is emerging as the primary threat to their survival. Wildlife trade and trafficking in Latin America has not reached the crisis levels that it has in Southeast Asia and Africa. However, Asian demand for wildlife products from a variety of species in Latin America is a growing concern and increasing pressure from international demand is now more evident than in past decades. Similar conditions were present less than two decades ago in Africa prior to the Asian-driven declines in Africa´s megafauna that we see today; preventive measures can and must be taken now in Latin America to prevent a repetition of this. The current nature of the trade in wildlife and the manner in which this trade is evolving suggest that far greater efforts are needed to mitigate its impacts on a wide range of endangered taxa, such as large felids, parrots, primates, frogs and lizards, species for which the illegal trade is emerging as the primary threat to their survival. Wildlife trade and trafficking in Latin America has not reached the crisis levels that it has in Southeast Asia and Africa.

Similar conditions were present less than two decades ago in Africa prior to the Asian-driven declines in Africa´s megafauna that we see today; preventive measures can and must be taken now in Latin America to prevent a repetition of this. Currently, the main challenges to addressing wildlife trafficking in Latin America are the lack of information on the extent, dynamics, and structure of illegal wildlife supply chains; that the issue is a low priority to governments in the region; legal frameworks are complex, poorly understood and inconsistently implemented; international and inter-agency enforcement cooperation on wildlife trafficking is weak; there is insufficient capacity to combat wildlife trafficking in key enforcement and judicial agencies; and collaboration between government and civil society to combat illegal wildlife trade is under-used. In order to address these challenges and emerging trends in wildlife trafficking, this paper proposes a cohesive and systematic approach, which involves: 1. Generating a more systematic understanding of the dynamics of transcontinental trafficking of wildlife from Latin America to Asia 2. Establishing mechanisms for enforcement cooperation between Latin America and Asia 3. Elevating the priority given to wildlife trafficking by governments and regional organizations in Latin America 4. Legal reform that enables greater compliance and promotes the use of ancillary legislation 5. Establish long-term programs to build leadership, commitment and capacity for countering wildlife trafficking.},

We analysed the most comprehensive data set on illegal wildlife trade currently available for Venezuela, from various sources, to provide a quantitative assessment of the magnitude, scope and detectability of the trade in psittacids at the national level. We calculated a specific offer index (SO) based on the frequency of which each species was offered for sale. Forty-seven species of psittacids were traded in Venezuela during 1981–2015, of which 17 were non-native. At least 641,675 individuals were traded, with an overall extraction rate of 18,334 individuals per year (35 years of accumulated reports). Amazona ochrocephala was the most frequently detected species (SO = 3.603), with the highest extraction rate (10,544 individuals per year), followed by Eupsittula pertinax (SO = 1.357) and Amazona amazonica (SO = 1.073). Amazona barbadensis , Ara ararauna and Ara chloropterus were the fourth most frequently detected species (SO = 0.564–0.615). Eleven species were involved principally in domestic trade ({\textgreater} 60{\%} of records). Our approach could be the first step in developing a national monitoring programme to inform national policy on the trade in psittacids. Patterns and numbers provided may be used to update the official list of threatened species, and could also be used in planning conservation actions.},

abstract = {Unsustainable harvest is one of the most important threats to biodiversity, and birds are highly impacted, but avian markets remain poorly understood. When spe- cies value and corruption/criminality are high, the “parallel trafficking” hypothesis predicts that illegal animal items will move through networks used for other illicit products. Alternatively, when particular demands, logistical skills or access limits trade, “specialized trafficking” hypotheses predict that few, expert actors will con- trol markets. Here, we use social network analysis of trade in an Endangered song- bird, the Red Siskin Spinus cucullatus, originating in Venezuela, to examine the generality of the parallel trafficking hypothesis in a setting where corruption/crimi- nality and species value are high. In spite of these circumstances, of 2575 Red Siskin (RS) records compiled from 2010 to 2017, we found just six reports consis- tent with parallel trafficking. Instead, we discovered an independent network of 15 actor types, and a trade structure consistent with specialized trafficking. Just two intermediary types (national vendors to intermediaries and to consumers) and one consumer type (national breeders) had the highest exposure to the flow of birds, and the most trade connectivity. Use of wild-caught over captive-bred birds was high (67{\%} of records), as was use of natural-phenotype birds over hybrid or mutant-phenotype birds (65{\%} of records). Geographically, Spain and Venezuela had the highest exposure to the flow of birds, but Brazil and Colombia had the most direct connections with other countries. The unexpected lack of evidence for parallel trafficking suggests that combined flows of illicit products are not inevita- ble, even in adverse settings. In a context where law enforcement may not be fea- sible, our results suggest that it may be possible to reduce unsustainable harvest using breeder connectivity in informational campaigns to stimulate peer-to-peer interactions and accelerate behavior change.},

They have been coveted as pets for centuries, particularly in the neo-tropics where they are heavily populated. Unfortunately, this has led to dramatic increases in parrot poaching over the last few decades, making parrots the most threatened bird species in the world. Despite laws against parrot poaching throughout the neo-tropics, the illegal trade con- tinues while parrot populations further decline. This article reviews the literature on the players in the illegal parrot trade (i.e. poachers, itinerant fences, and market sellers), how poaching is largely committed, and which species are more at risk of becoming poached.},

abstract = {The Yellow-shouldered Amazon (Amazona barbadensis) is one of the most endangered species of parrots in Venezuela. An integrated conservation program has focused on reversing the causes of parrot population decline on the Macanao Peninsula in Margarita Island. As a result, the parrot population on the island has increased to about 1900 individuals in 1996 from an estimated population of 750 in 1989, when the project started. Cooperation from national and local authorities and the project's community outreach have resulted in several confiscated chicks. Whereas most confiscated chicks were successfully reintroduced in a cross-fostering nest program, some had to be kept in captivity for later release. We hand-reared 14 A. barbadensis and housed them for a year in a large outdoor aviary. Before release the birds were screened to determine their general health. Four parrots were fitted with radio transmitters and monitored for a minimum of 11 months. All 4 birds with radio transmitters survived and adapted successfully to their natural environment, 10 of the 12 released parrots survived at least 1 year, and 1 was seen alive 34 months after release. Integration into wild groups varied from 5 days to 9 months, with the two youngest parrots showing a slower integration process. None of the parrots reproduced the first year after release. Later three were seen scouting nesting holes with their partners, and one of the parrots was confirmed attending a nest with three eggs 28 months after release. Two chicks fledged from this nest. A substantial portion of the success of this program rests on 5 years of previous work on environmental education, public awareness, and studies on the parrot's biology. To provide some guidance on the costs of reintroduction projects, we estimated an overall expenditure of about U.S. 2800 per parrot. Previous attempts to reintroduce captive-raised parrots have had limited success, and our study indicates that reintroduction is feasible when captive-raised parrots are introduced to an area with a resident population. Although reintroduction can significantly reduce the chances of extinction, it also involves some risks. The long-term solution against extinction of A. barbadensis will be a combination of scientific understanding of their biology and habitat, awareness by local human communities, reduction in the wild bird trade, and continued commitment by conservation enforcement agencies.},

abstract = {Illegal wildlife trade is a widespread activity with direct impacts on biodiversity and street markets are frequently pointed out as hotspots in the wildlife trade route. However, due to its illegal character, it is difficult to accurately estimate how many individuals and how much money are handled by traders. Precise data on the number of individuals and species involved, and the drivers behind the illegal wildlife trade are essential for fighting it. We use the example of the metropolitan area of Recife, in northeastern Brazil, a well-known route of illegal wildlife in the country, to access the extent and impact street markets may have on biodiversity. We present quantitative and qualitative information on the illegal trade of wild birds in eight street markets in the area, indicating which species are preferred and why, estimating the number of animals and the volume of money involved, and quantifying the impact that the removal of those animals may have. We observed a high and diversified species offer, biased towards adult male songbirds, with birds of 15 families and 55 species on sale. Birds are kept in poor conditions and some individuals are sold for as little as US{\$} 1.00. However, we projected that up to 50,000 wild birds may be sold annually in the markets surveyed, including possibly 16,800 individuals of Sporophila nigricollis (the yellow-bellied seedeater), the most frequently observed species. The activity is profitable and may deal with significant amounts of money (up to nearly US{\$} 630,000.00/year). The numbers involved indicate that street markets are significant wildlife sinks, with a large and frequently ignored impact that must be taken into account in the control and conservation of the biodiversity, not just in Brazil but elsewhere.},

abstract = {Large numbers of birds, including more than 68 000 wild-caught and reportedly captive-bred CITES-listed individuals, were imported from the Solomon Islands in the 2000s. The vast majority were imported by Malaysia and Singapore and often re-exported, particularly in the case of Singapore. In terms of species composition, there were a few species native to the Solomon Islands, however the majority (77{\%}) were non-native species from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. 13 736 individuals of these non-native species were exported as “captive-bred”. However, it is unclear how the parent stock of these captive-bred birds was acquired as there is no documented export of these CITES-listed species to the Solomon Islands. In terms of the number of individual birds involved in the trade, the majority of exports were species native to the Solomon Islands (54 793). Of these native bird species, 13 692 were declared as wild-caught and 41 101 were reportedly captive-bred. These large numbers of native and non-native captive-bred birds suggest the existence of commercial breeding facilities on the Solomon Islands capable of housing thousands of breeding pairs. However, in 2006, CITES reported the Solomon Islands was “not known to have substantial bird breeding facilities” and a comprehensive State of the Environment report published by the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Meterology (the Solomon Islands' CITES Scientific Authority and Management Authority) in 2008 makes no mention of captive-breeding or captive-breeding facilities for birds. Meanwhile the Environment Conservation Division (ECD) informed TRAFFIC researchers (in litt.) that although there were registered bird breeders in the islands, they were not breeding birds, only taking them from the wild. Furthermore, the ECD wrote: “There are no breeding facilities, only some confusion with storing facilities. Most of the exported birds were captured and kept in holding sites only.” Solomons},

abstract = {Social marketing campaigns use marketing techniques to influence human behavior for the greater social good. In the conservation sector, social marketing campaigns have been used to influence behavior for the benefit of biodiversity as well as society. However, there are few evaluations of their effectiveness. We devised an approach for evaluating the influences of social marketing campaigns on human behavior and conservation outcomes. We used general elimination methodology, a theory-driven qualitative evaluation method, to assess the long-term impacts of a 1998 Rare Pride campaign on the island of Bonaire that was designed to increase the population of the Lora (Amazona barbadensis), a threatened parrot. We interviewed stakeholder groups to determine their perceptions of the drivers of the changes in the Lora population over time. We used these data to develop an overall theory of change to explain changes in the Lora population by looking at the overlap in hypotheses within and between stakeholder groups. We then triangulated that theory of change with evidence from government reports, peer-reviewed literature, and newspapers. The increase in the Lora population was largely attributed to a decrease in illegal poaching of Loras and an associated decrease in local demand for pet Loras. Decreases in poaching and demand were likely driven by a combination of law enforcement, social marketing (including the Rare campaign), and environmental education in schools. General elimination methodology helped show how multiple interventions influenced a conservation outcome over time. There is a need for evidence-based evaluations of social marketing interventions to ensure that limited resources are spent wisely.},

In this research, we characterized the land cover of the potential geographical distribu- tion area of eight extant parrot species within the Yucatan Peninsula. We used the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) and species historical records. To externally validate the models, we used presence and absence records from field observations (2010-2012). To characterize the distribution area, we used the vegetation and land use maps of INEGI Series IV (2007-2010). The models showed a good performance, according to the values of the area under the curve (AUC), which ranged between 0.88-0.95 with the training data and between 0.82-0.91 with test data. We located most of the species in sites where the models predicted their presence. In the Peninsula, over 76{\%} of the parrots' potential geographical distribution area is forested, except for Amazona oratrix. The subhumid tropical forest is the best represented, and the livestock for land use. The most affected species within the Peninsula are: Amazona farinosa and A. oratrix. The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve is the most important area for parrots' protection in the Peninsula. Knowing the characteristics of distribution areas is an essential part in the establishment of parrots' conservation strategies.},

abstract = {Environmental crime is estimated to be worth between {\$}91 and 258 billion, with wildlife crime making up {\$}7 to 23 billion of the total,i and is currently estimated to be growing at two to three times the speed of the global economy.ii Over the past few years, myriad studies and reports have examined the economic and environmental devastation wreaked by wildlife crime, as well as its intertwining links to transnational criminal networks.iii iv Few studies, however, have focused on the transport systems used by wildlife traffickers, despite the large benefits that traffickers have gained from the increasing interconnectedness of global infrastructure and transport systems. Flying Under the Radar examines wildlife trafficking through the air transport sector, and is designed to support law enforcement and the private sector's efforts to stem the hidden flow of illegal wildlife through their jurisdictions and supply chains. Given the covert nature of illegal activity, wildlife traffickers' past, current, and potential future moves must be assessed by obtaining and analyzing detailed wildlife seizure data. Where this data exists, however, it exists largely in partial and incomplete form, or held disparately and privately by various intergovernmental organizations and enforcement agencies. To mitigate this challenge, C4ADS' analysts spent three months building a baseline of information by collecting and structuring open source seizure data for four categories of wildlife and wildlife products (ivory, rhino horn, live reptiles, and live birds). These categories were specifically chosen based on data availability and trafficking frequency, and collectively account for about 66{\%} of trafficked wildlife products, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).v C4ADS' analysts collected the majority of this data from country reporting and news media, as most seizure databases do not provide the requisite detail for inclusion in an assessment of air trafficking. The use of seizure data, while currently the best method available for investigating trafficking activity of all types, can lead to a variety of mistaken conclusions. For instance, better public seizure reporting may create the appearance of a trafficking problem where none exists. Still, seizure data, taken together with the appropriate caveats, provides a good picture of overall trafficking activity, and can be used to direct future anti-trafficking efforts. Wildlife trafficking is a global problem that takes advantage of enforcement loopholes, lack of awareness, limited public and private sector coordination, capacity gaps, and lagging technology and procedures to move illicit products through the licit transportation system. As international travel continues to exponentially increase, particularly in the air transport sector, enforcement and the private sector should make immediate changes to better stem the international flow of illicit wildlife. Without such changes, wildlife traffickers will continue to find the illegal wildlife trade a profitable, comparatively easy and low-risk enterprise, at substantial detriment to ecosystems, economies, and global security.

abstract = {Ecological niche models provide useful predictions of species distributions, but may fail to detect reductions in distribution due to factors other than habitat loss, such as hunting or trade. From 2001 to 2009, we conducted field-surveys along the Mexican Pacific coast to obtain presence–absence data for nine Psittacidae species. We applied Genetic Algorithm for Rule set Prediction (GARP) ecological niche modeling, using field-survey presence data to determine the potential current distribution of each species, and incorporated absence data to delineate extirpation areas. All parrot species showed a reduced current distribution, ranging from 9.6 to 79{\%} reduction of estimated original distribution. The threatened and endemic species of Amazona oratrix, Amazona finschi, and Forpus cyanopygius suffered the greatest distribution reduction, higher than previously estimated by habitat-based models, suggesting that capture for trade may have caused extirpation of these species. The greatest extent of current distribution was occupied by Aratinga canicularis, Amazona albifrons and Ara militaris, which continue to occur throughout most of their original distribution. Amazona auropalliata, Aratinga strenua, and Brotogeris jugularis also occur throughout their restricted distribution in coastal Chiapas, and show a relatively small distribution reduction, but had the highest proportion of modified lands within their current distributions. Our results highlighted the regions of coastal Guerrero, northern Nayarit, and southern Sinaloa where parrot species have been extirpated even though GARP models predicted suitable habitat available. Ideally distribution models should be verified in the field to determine conservation priorities, and efforts should be directed to maintain populations of species with greatest distribution reductions.},
